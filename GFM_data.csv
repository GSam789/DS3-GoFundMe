The shooting has now left my son critically injured as he fights for his life. The extent of my son’s injuries is unknown, but we remain prayerful as he continues to undergo multiple rounds of operations to save his life.

This fund is established to cover my son’s medical expenses, mental and grief counseling for our family and to assist our family in the days to come, as we continue to seek justice for Jacob.  A portion of these proceeds will also be used to benefit my son’s six children, some of whom witnessed this horrific act of violence.

Tommy Rivers and his beautiful family have been a shining light guiding so many through dark times; now is the time to reciprocate and prove that love is, indeed, always the answer. As some of you may know, almost a month ago, Tommy Rivs was admitted to the ICU with respiratory issues. After several weeks of testing and a lung biopsy, doctors discovered the presence of cancer. Specifically, Tommy Rivers was diagnosed with Primary Pulmonary NK T-Cell Lymphoma, a very rare and aggressive form of Lymphoma. Tommy was moved to a hospital in Scottsdale, AZ, where he is receiving chemotherapy under the guidance and expertise of some of the leading lymphoma physicians in the world.  As you can imagine, this treatment is expensive, and Tommy and his family could use all of the financial support they can get.Your generosity can help lighten the load, so that he can focus on recovery, as he taught us to do. Your kind donation will go directly to Steph and Tommy to help deal with the financial repercussions of his current condition, so they can focus on healing and supporting one another. Other ways to help: Because love knows no bounds and neither does Tommy’s heart, even from his ICU bed, he urged us to consider donating to provide emergency assistance to families of the Navajo nation, through an organization that is dear to him, Ajooba' Hasin, Families to Families. https://www.gofundme.com/f/clean-water-for-navajo

I am a wife and proud mother of a beautiful 2-year-old boy, Dean, and we live in New Milford, a small town in northern New Jersey. I was recently diagnosed with Stage 4 colon cancer.  I need your help with medical expenses and family support in the fight for my life.On July 13th of this year, my entire world was turned upside down.  I was rushed to the ER with severe pain in my abdomen and the doctors discovered a large mass on my ovary. This set off a whirlwind of tests to understand the root cause of my illness. Days after my 35th birthday, and less than 2 years after having Dean, I was diagnosed with colon cancer.  The doctors initially thought it was ovarian cancer. They said they had to remove my ovary and I was rushed in for emergency surgery. I was horrified because my husband and I had just started trying for our second child.  The doctors gave us hope by explaining that I could become pregnant with one ovary, but our hearts were heavy. As it turned out, this was far from the worst of our problems. Days later, I received a diagnosis that will forever shake me to my core. I have Stage 4 colon cancer. It has spread to my lungs, liver and remaining ovary. As a statistic, I am grim.I was paralyzed from shock after hearing this news, in a constant state of tears. I thought about my baby, who needs his mother. I thought about all of the milestones I have witnessed in his short life, and the many more which lie ahead. I thought about our delightful, ordinary days.  Seeing his eyes light up at cars and trucks.  His hugs. Dean’s life without me is not a thought that my husband or I can swallow. Two months into chemotherapy treatments, I am in capable hands and grateful for my doctors. But I am quite ill from the treatments, and we have quickly learned that our insurance will not cover some of the most critical aspects of my longer-term care, including many alternative and integrative therapies and experimental trials.  I am a young mother, and a short life span of suboptimal quality simply will not do. My husband is becoming an expert in my care, and I recently became a vegan under the direction a nutritionist who challenges traditional approaches to cancer and food.  I also continue to be an active mom to Dean, who is blissfully unaware. He celebrated his 2nd birthday this month amid the great excitement of his new toys and trucks. In the coming months, I need to travel nationwide to get treatment from doctors who don’t accept my insurance and receive medicine that is not covered either. I will undoubtedly need primary care from my husband, who will have to take time off without pay. The financial costs we face are staggering, but we are strong and determined.  We will not give up without a fight that will make our son proud. We are telling you our story because we need your help. If you can make a financial donation to help us, we will forever be grateful. Our son will grow up knowing the goodness in others, who gave his mother a chance to continue fighting to be here for him. If you cannot donate, please share our story, or share stories with us about people who challenge traditional boundaries in the fight against cancer. Every little bit helps.Thank you from the bottom of my heart for taking the time to read this.

6 month old Rhys needs a life saving drug that costs $2.1 million. Follow Rhys’s story and current updates at www.RiseUpForRhys.org and on Instagram @RiseUpForRhysIn May of 2019 while on vacation in Scotland, Rory and I found out we were pregnant (though I already knew - mother’s intuition kicks in early!)  Our baby girl was due on Christmas Day, and after a perfectly healthy pregnancy and 20 hours of labor, we welcomed her 3 weeks early on December 4, 2019 at 12:13pm. Even though I had sworn not to give my children confusing-to-pronounce Welsh names as my mother had done to me, we decided to name her Rhys (pronounced Reese). Overnight she made us a family, and even her fur brother Bruce was absolutely in love. (Jury is still out for Tony).Rhys had been a healthy baby, loving her baths, walks outside, and cuddles and kisses from her doggies. As Rhys approached 4 months, that mother’s intuition was nagging me - I noticed that she seemed to be falling behind on milestones other babies her age were hitting. She always struggled with tummy time, and wasn’t able to roll over or hold her head up for very long. At her 4 month check up, our pediatrician said she just had low muscle tone and recommended physical therapy. At her next check up at 6 months, the pediatrician immediately noted Rhys’ lack of progression and expressed concerns that she may have Spinal Muscular Atrophy, a genetic condition we had never heard of before. A quick Google search, confirmed every parent’s greatest fear: ""The number 1 genetic disease that kills most babies up to 2 years old."" Appointments with Geneticists and Pediatric Neuro-muscular Specialists were set, blood and saliva tests ordered, and the waiting began. We hoped it was something else less severe, easier to treat, less devastating. ANYTHING but SMA. After 2 weeks, the longest 2 weeks of our lives, we received the heartbreaking diagnosis - Rhys has SMA Type 1, the most severe form of the disease.SMA is a terminal muscle degenerative disease, affecting eating, speaking, moving and even breathing. It results in muscle wasting where infants often die of respiratory failure ​before reaching the age of two. With SMA Type 1, each day means loss of specialized nerve cells, leading to muscle weakness and muscle cell death. It is so rare that just a few years ago, there was no treatment. Parents had to watch as their child was able to move less and less, becoming unable to eat and breath on their own.There is no cure for SMA, but in the last 2 years, two life changing treatments have become available. One treatment, SPINRAZA, works on the SMN2 gene, which is a less active copy of the SMN1 gene (the gene that is missing/non-functioning in a person with SMA). By boosting production of SMN2, SPINRAZA supports muscle development and provides a level of improvement. SPINRAZA is very expensive at $750K in the first year and $375K every year thereafter for life. In August of 2019, a new gene therapy, ZOLGENSMA was approved by the FDA. It replaces the missing/non-functioning SMN1 gene with a new functional copy. This medicine provides life changing improvement, some patients are even able to walk independently. Such a miracle drug comes at a cost, and ZOLGENSMA is the most expensive drug in the world at $2.1 million USD. Because SMA Type 1 is aggressive and degenerative, this is a race against time. With each day that passes, motor neurons in Rhys’ sweet little body are becoming inactive. All funds raised will go to Rhys’s medical care including gene therapy (out-of-pocket responsibility outside of insurance not known at this time), physical and occupational therapy, mobility and development equipment, etc. She has a lifetime ahead of her and will need continuous treatment for the best chance at a full life. In the case there are additional funds beyond Rhys’s needs, they will go to Cure SMA, an organization dedicated to raising awareness for this devastating disease. Every child should have the best possible chance at life - please join us to surround our happy little girl in love and support.

Bu kampanya sadece sevgili Mercan'ımızın tedavi masraflarını karşılamaya adanmıştır.Mercan'ın hikayesini aşağıda paylaşıyorum. ================================Life for MercanI am organizing this fundraiser campaign for my cousin’s beloved 7-month old daughter, Mercan Çorakçı. Mercan was diagnosed with a rare genetic disease called Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) Type 1 during her routine 3-month wellness check. Luckily, there is a gene therapy treatment named Zolgensma that was approved by the FDA and EMA which would enable Mercan to live a healthy life. Mercan needs to receive this one-time treatment as soon as possible to avoid irreversible neuro-muscular damage. The total cost of this treatment along with the additional costs to receive the treatment in the US adds up to $2.4 million. Hearing that you need $2.4 million to save your precious baby’s life can be daunting, but we believe we can achieve this with your support. Please help Ege and Can get their daughter, Mercan, this treatment and give Mercan a life. This fundraiser is solely dedicated to cover the costs of Mercan’s treatment.Scroll down to read more about Mercan, her diagnosis, and the treatment below.================================Mercan'ın HikayesiMercan'ımız 02.01.2020 tarihinde ailemizin ikinci evladı, oğlumuz Mete'mizin sevgili kardeşi olarak dünyaya geldi. Çekirdek aile olarak çok mutlu olduğumuz günlerden biriydi. Sağlıklı bir doğum sonrası Mercan yavrumuzu kucağımıza alarak anne baba olmanın mutluluğunu hayatımızda ikinci kez yaşamaktaydık. Mete'miz kardeşinin doğduğu günden hastaneden ayrılıncaya kadarki süreçte  kardeşine gösterdiği sevgi ile çok güzel ve değerli bir ağabeylik yapacağını bize göstermişti. Rutin bir hastane sürecinden sonra evimize geldik ve yeni yaşantımıza başladık. 4 kişilik mutlu ve sağlıklı bir ailemiz olacak derken, Mercan'ın hareketlerindeki yavaşlama ile ilgili gözlemlerimiz bizleri endişeye sürükledi. 3. ay rutin doktor muayenesinde Çocuk Doktor'umuz bizi Çocuk Nörologu Uzmanı'na yönlendirdi ve hayatımızın tamamen değişeceğinin ilk sinyallerini aslında o gün anladık. Vakit kaybetmeden Çocuk Nörologu Uzman Doktoru'na muayeneye gittik ve o gün adını ilk defa duyduğumuz bir hastalıktan; Spinal Müsküler Atrofi'den (SMA) şüphelenildiğini öğrendik. O dakika itibari ile korkarak araştırdığımız SMA hastalığının ne kadar zor ve yıkıcı bir hastalık olduğunu öğrenmeye başladık. Kesin tanı konabilmesi için genetik test yapılması gerektiğinden hızlıca tahlil için kan örneği verilmesi ile sonunun neye varacağı, bilinmezlerin ve kaygıların yer aldığı bir sürecin tüm ailemiz için başladığının farkına varmıştık. Tahlil sonucu çıkana kadar her hastalıkta olduğu gibi insanın özellikle kendi evladına böyle bir hastalığı yakıştırması mümkün gelmemişti, ta ki 14.04.2020 tarihinde genetik test raporu çıkıncaya kadar: ""Bu bulgular SMA hastalığı ile uyumludur"". O güne kadar bir ümit ile güzel haberler beklediğimiz sonuç, olumsuz gelmiş ve aslında Mercanı'mızın bebeklerde 1 numaralı ölümcül bir genetik hastalıkla doğduğu gerçeği ile bizleri karşı karşıya bırakmıştı. O an itibari ile tüm hayallerimizin ve tüm planlarımızın başka bir yöne doğru sürüklendiğinin farkına varmaya başlamıştık.SMA, nefes alma, hareket etme, yemek yeme gibi motor hareketleri sağlayan vücudumuzdaki kasların zayıflanmasına ve ilerleyen aşamada tamamen durmasına sebep olan ilerleyici bir nöromüsküler hastalıktır. Bu hastalık SMN1 genine ait 7. ve 8. ekzonlardaki mutasyon veya delesyon sonucu ortaya çıkmakta ve motor nöronların ihtiyaç duyduğu protein SMN1 geni tarafından üretilemediğinden vücuttaki motor nöronların geri dönüşü olmayan kaybı söz konusu olmaktadır. Bunun sonucunda istemli kaslar iyi hareket edemez, kuvvetsizleşir ve kas zayıflığı (atrofi) meydana gelmektedir. Mercan'ımız şu an 7 aylık ve ilerleyici bir hastalık olduğunda dolayı en kısa sürede gen tedavisi olması gerektiği 2 farklı Çocuk Nörologu Hekim tarafından şiddetle önerilmiştir. Novartis ilaç firmasının alt kuruluşu olan Avexis firması tarafından üretilmekte olan Zolgensma Gen Tedavisi ile tek dozluk damardan uygulama yöntemi ile bu hastalığın kalıcı olarak tedavi edilmesi mümkündür. Bu sayede  sağlıklı bir bebeğin sahip olduğu motor hareketlerine Mercan'ımızın da kavuşması mümkün olacaktır.Motor nöronların kalıcı olarak uykuya geçmesinden önce (fonksiyonlarını tamamen kaybetmeden) bu tedavinin yapılması gerektiğinden, Mercan'ımız zaman ile yarışmakta ve her geçen vakit onun aleyhine işlemektedir.Mercan şu an yaşıtı bir bebeğin olması gereken kas kuvvetine erişmiş durumda değil. Onun yaşıtları gibi gelişimini sürdürebilmesi, sağlıklı ve özgür bir çocuk olabilmesi için sizlerin Mercan'ımızın destekleyicisi olmanızı ve bizlere bu zor süreçte yardım etmenizi diliyoruz.Mercan'a can için bize destek verir misiniz?Sevgiler,Ege ve Can Çorakçı================================Mercan's StoryMercan was born on January 02, 2020. She is our second child and the little sister of our beloved son Mete. We were elated to become parents for a second time after a healthy pregnancy and delivery. Mete proved himself to be a loving brother from the moment Mercan was born and came home with us.After an uneventful hospital stay, we brought Mercan home and started our new life as a family of four. As we were enjoying our newborn days and dreaming of a happy and healthy future, we noticed a developmental delay in our daughter’s movements. When we brought this concern up with our pediatrician, he referred us to a pediatric neurologist. We got the sense that our world was about to turn upside down soon. We got an appointment from a pediatric neurologist right away and were informed that doctors were suspecting a disease that we had never heard before, Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA).When we researched SMA, we learned that it was a severely degenerative disorder. A genetic test was needed for an exact diagnosis. The waiting period for the results was devastating. Honestly, like many parents, we still hung on to the thinnest thread of hope that it wasn’t SMA, rather something simpler and easily curable until the results arrived. When we received the report on April 14, 2020, and read the statement where it said “Findings are compatible with SMA Type 1,”  we were faced with the harsh reality that our baby daughter was born with a genetic disease with the grimmest prognosis. At that time, the path of our lives took a sharp turn.Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a disease that robs people of physical strength by affecting the motor nerve cells in the spinal cord, taking away the ability to walk, eat, or breathe. It is the number one genetic cause of death for infants. SMA is caused by a mutation in the survival motor neuron gene 1 (SMN1). In a healthy person, this gene produces a protein that is critical to the function of the nerves that control our muscles. Without it, those nerve cells cannot properly function and eventually die, leading to debilitating and sometimes fatal muscle weakness. (Source: curesma.org)SMA is a fast-progressing disease. Two pediatric neurologists recommended that Mercan receive the gene therapy treatment to stop the progression as soon as possible. The gene therapy named Zolgensma which is manufactured by Avexis, owned by Novartis can prevent further motor neuron and muscle degeneration by replacing the defective or missing gene (SMN1) that causes Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA). With this one-time treatment, Mercan will be able to move and live as a healthy girl.Mercan is seven months old now. Her muscular development is visibly delayed compared to her peers and we are racing against time to get this treatment for Mercan before her motor neurons permanently atrophy. We need your support on this difficult journey so that Mercan can grow up to be healthy, strong, and abled. Please contribute to Mercan’s fundraising campaign, so that she can get her treatment as soon as possible.Sincerely,Ege and Can Çorakçı"

This rehabilitation is critical to her future well-being and ultimately to her return to home. Chelsea’s family is praying for a generous outpouring of donations to facilitate paying for these extraordinary costs.Chelsea is a 29-year-old woman who miraculously survived catastrophic injuries sustained on April 15, 2020.  She was a pedestrian on the sidewalk in the City of Buffalo, NY when a police SUV responding to a 911 call, crashed into a car, lost control and struck her. She flew a great distance and suffered multiple fractures, including severe injuries to her spine and brain stem.  Chelsea is currently quadriplegic and ventilator dependent.  She has miraculously regained cognitive function and has the same great personality. She engages with family and friends via FaceTime using facial expressions, eye motions and by mouthing words. Chelsea is a joyful, selfless human being who leads a life of Discipleship. She is a teacher of English to speakers of other languages and loves refugees. She recently became a realtor with the ambition of finding decent housing for the immigrant/refugee community in Buffalo, NY.  Chelsea has done missionary work in 12 different countries around the world. Her love for Christ and passion for spreading His word is her main objective in life. Within the last year, Chelsea bought a house and started an educational ministry out of her home to help refugee children and their families. She also regularly held Bible study in her home hoping that others might also be empowered by the love of Christ.  Friends of Chelsea created a Facebook Group entitled “Chelsea’s Army” which is now over 2,100 members strong.  Individuals from this group have been fervently praying for her over the past six very challenging weeks.  Places of worship and people in all 50 of the United States and in 72 different countries around the globe are praying for her restoration.

Our daughter Siyona took step in this world on 12th of September 2019. I still remember that day. We were very happy as i hold her in my arms. She was a healthy baby girl and i still remember her bright and big eyes staring me. We immediately fell in love with her and start thinking of her future. We thought of providing her every needs of her life- a good education and most important a better human. Everyday with her went on so fast when we realized she already turned 4 months. I then began to realize she was not able to hold her head nor turn sideways. She was breastfeeding normally and was gaining her usual weight. Some of our family members told this is normal and she will be be holding her head in few months. We believed and carried on dreaming of her bright future.

Days passed on and she was now 5 months. Still she was not holding her head. Now we were worried,so visited our doctor. Our doctor examined and did some neurological exam, few blood tests and a brain scan. Everything was normal and we were told she might be having a benign hypotonia of infancy. Just a bit physiotherapy and nothing much to worry about: I still remember my doctor words. We were happy she was alright and began her physiotherapy. Now she was 6 months, still hypotonic. We knew something was not right and again visited our doctor. Now our doctor advised us to visit a senior neurologist and we did so. I still remember that day, the saddest day of our life, the day when our dreams were shattered. The neurologist after assessing our child and looking the prior reports immediately told us she might be a having a neuromuscular disease only to be confirmed by genetic disease and most probably our child might be having the severe form of the disease. That was the day when we first heard of this disease called SPINAL MUSCULAR ATROPHY. Blood was drawn and sent for genetic testing and we returned with heavy hearts.

I was very tensed and started looking after it in internet. I was told about it a bit by my neurologist. It is a progressive neuromuscular disease that gradual weakens the muscles of limbs,swallowing and breathing. You can imagine the outcome. My child can’t sit up nor walk stand, she will not be able to eat and drink and finally not able to breathe on her own. Without timely treatment most of infants with severe form of SMA will be on permanent ventilation within a year of life and rarely survive beyond two years. I was always praying to god that our reports will be negative but i was wrong. Finally got the reports that showed my daughter Siyona had type 1 SMA. My neurologist told me the prognosis and gene therapy was the only cure. Gene therapy drug called Zolgensma costs nearly 2.1 million usd and we are no longer in a position to afford. We need your support to afford my daughter's treatment. I wish to see her stand and run and fulfill her dream. Please donate for my daughter and fulfill her desire to live and achieve her dream. We believe Siyona is one of the luckiest to receive Zolgensma.


UPDATE-Utilization of fund.What if?


  Lastly what is the plan if target is not met? How will the raised funds be utilised?

First of all, seeing the support of all wellwishers all around the globe, I don’t see anything why our target won’t be met. Siyona deserves life and there are so many prayers and efforts that can’t be unheard by the God.  We will achieve the target.  I am her father and I have seen her suffering everyday and if any mishap happens or funds couldn’t be raised, then the funds will be utilised only for the palliative care of Siyona. I am a Nepal based doctor and I have seen how difficult is there for a Nepali patient to fight SMA. The remaining funds will be utilised to raise a SMA foundation in Nepal that will work entirely for the upliftment of SMA patients in Nepal including their palliative care. We are already on this process and the legal formalities are delayed by covid. We will soon update the process.



Questions:

Bebeğimiz doğduğunda her şey çok normaldi, ta ki 4.ayına kadar… Hareketlerinin giderek yavaşladığını fark edip hastaneye gittiğimizde acı gerçekle yüzleştik. Oğlumuza, canımıza SMA TİP1 adı verilen genetik ve ölümcül bir kas hastalığı teşhisi konuldu. Bu hastalık kasları besleyerekhareket etmemizi sağlayan genin olmamasından kaynaklanıyor. Hastalık tedavi edilmediği takdirde ilerleyici ve ölümcül sonuçlar doğuruyor. SMN1 geninin bir mutasyon sebebi ile yok olması ve motor nöron sinir hücrelerinin bu genin ürettiği proteini alamaması sonucunda ortaya çıkan bu hastalık,tüm dünyada bebek ölümlerine yol açan genetik geçişli hastalıklar arasında ilk sırada gelmektedir. Yürüme, nefes alma, yutkunma, konuşma gibi hayati önem taşıyan sistemleri yok etmektedir. Bu hastalığın 4 tipi vardır ve en ağır türü olan 1.TİP hastalar bebeklik çağında (çoğunlukla 2 yaşından önce) gelişemeyen akciğer kapasiteleri nedeni ile yaşamlarını kaybediyorlar. Bu hastalığın tek çaresi ise Amerika’da tek doz uygulama ile tedavi edici özellikli Zolgensma adlı gen tedavisidir. Bu gen tedavisi SMA hastalığının kök sebebini çözebiliyor. Oğlumuz Doğu’nun bu gen tedavisini almasını sağlamaya çalışıyoruz. Damar içine sadece bir defalık enjeksiyon ile Doğu’ya eksik olan SMN geni motor nöron hücrelerine iletiliyor ve geriye sadece onun kaslarını fizik tedavi yüzme vs ile güçlendirmemiz kalıyor. Ancak bu tedavinin uygulanma fiyatı tüm masraflar ile birlikte 2,4 Milyon Dolar… Bu ilacı alamadığı her gün motor nöronları zarar görüyor ve ölüyor… Doğu şu anda 1 yaşında ve zamanımız her geçen gün daralıyor çünkü bu ilaç yalnızca 2 yaşına kadar alınabiliyor. ilacı ne kadar erken alabilirsek iyileşme şansımız o kadar yüksek. Doğu için global bir bağış sitesi olan Gofundme üzerinden bir yardım kampanyası başlattık. Doğu’nun tek çaresi olan bu ilaca ulaşması ve yaşaması için sizlerin desteğine ihtiyacımız var. Sesimizi duymanız ve oğlumuza umut olmanız dileği ile… Sevgiler… Doğu’nun Anne ve Babası Şive & Çetin ÜLKER Tel : +90 536 977 08 24 --------------------------------------------------------------------- Save DOGU’s Life ! I am starting a campaign for DOGU ULKER who is the son of my close friends Sive and Cetin ULKER. DOGU was diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type 1. In order to have a  better future, DOGU has to receive a genetic therapy called Zolgensma. Zolgensma total costs $ 2.4 million with additional expenses. Zolgensma approval only covers children under 2 years. DOGU  is 12 months old. We have a fight against the time. He must receive his treatment in the United States. Below, you can find the story of DOGU and his family. Your donations will be greatly appreciated. This campaign is dedicated exclusively to DOGU. ---------------------------------------------------------------- Save DOGU’s Life ! We are writing for saving our 1-year-old son DOGU’s life… When DOGU was born, everything was going fine until his 4th month and after we observed weakness of tendon reflexes (inability to use his hands while playing small toys!). After many doctor's checks we faced reality is that our son DOGU was diagnosed with SMA TYPE-1. SMA (Spinal Muscular Atrophy) is a neuromuscular disease, which manifested by a progressive loss of muscle strength that affects the ability to walk, swallow and breathe and it is the first genetic cause of infant mortality.  SMA has 4 types of risk level and our son DOGU has Type 1 which is the most highly risky one for mortal resultant! ONLY TREATMENT is genetic therapy called Zolgensma , and TOTAL COST OF THERAPY is $ 2.4 million and  must be received treatment in the United States. This genetic therapy only beneficial if treatment received less than 2-years-old. In addition, our son DOGU is 1-year-old and we are FIGHTING AGAINST THE TIME…  WE STARTED A DONATION CAMPAIGN over GoFundMe is the world’s largest, free social fundraising platform. To reach $ 2.4 million for genetic therapy to save DOGU’s LIFE; we need the support of volunteers who can help us during this fight and donate motor neurons for our little son. We are full of hope that we will Save DOGU’s LIFE with your donations… This campaign dedicated exclusively to DOGU’s treatment.  Best Regards, DOGU’s Mom & Dad; Sive & Cetin ULKER

Tuesday 8/4/2020 – a day Beirut and the world will never forget. A massive explosion took place on Tuesday August 4th 2020 in the heart of Lebanon leaving hundreds of casualties and thousands without homes, shelter, medicine and/or food. Hospitals were already overwhelmed by the COVID-19 pandemic that they are forced to turn away some victims who are seeking care, shelter and food. Lebanon has seen dark times but nothing like what the people are enduring today. Job opportunities have vanished and unemployment is worsening by the second. Dealing with a political and economic crisis as well as a health crisis affecting the most vulnerable, they are now at risk of a HUNGER crisis. Lebanon is in a state of Humanitarian crisis and needs your help right now! We are 3 physician sisters, originally from Lebanon but raised in the United States. Our father is a pediatrician and his father was also a pediatrician -- so helping others has always been something deep-rooted in our souls. Through the support of Jobs For Lebanon, a 501c3 nonprofit, we are being connected directly to local partners within Lebanon to help procure and distribute basic food needs. $25 is able to feed a family of 5 for 1 month! We personally guarantee that every dollar that you donate goes directly to feeding the victims and survivors of this unspeakable tragedy.We are so grateful, beyond words, from the deepest bottom of our hearts for any contribution no matter how big or small. Your generosity means the world to us and to the people of Lebanon. Love,Nadine, Nayla & Shereene Idriss

A full genetic screening revealed that not only Kinley, but her younger sister Kennedy both have an extremely rare genetic disorder called GM1 Gangliosidosis.  We are forever thankful that baby Kieran is not affected by this wretched disease. Currently, there is no approved treatment or cure for GM1, and it is always fatal in children.********OUR NEW REALITYGM1 Gangliosidosis is an aggressive disease where the body does not produce adequate enzymes to break down certain molecules. Instead, these molecules collect on the brain and spinal cord, leading to widespread neurodegeneration. The list of complications that our girls face is truly terrifying and the idea of watching them slowly fade away is our worst nightmare. Right now, Kinley and Kennedy are in a relatively “stable” state in their disease progression.  They can still walk independently and are verbal, though both are experiencing speech issues that make them hard to understand.  Looking at them, one would never know they both face such a grave fate, but there will come a day where each of them will no longer be able to run outside with their friends, jump on their trampoline, or tell their baby sister “I love you” if no treatments are developed.   Kinley, who wants nothing more than to be a doctor, nurse, or vet so she can help other people, will eventually not be able to take care of herself independently.  Kennedy, who loves to dance and sing and dress up, will someday not be able to do her infamous twirls and leaps, or “freeze” you with her Elsa powers.Each morning, we wake to the reality that we are another day closer to that outcome.  One day, they won’t recognize their mom and dad.  One day, they won’t be able to tell us they need something, or that they love us.  One day, they will require a feeding tube.  One day,  we will lay two of our precious babies to rest.Life expectancy for the type of GM1 Kinley and Kennedy have is difficult to predict, but estimates range anywhere from mid-childhood (10-15 years old) to the early twenties.  We are hopeful that both Kinley and Kennedy have many more great years ahead of them at a quality of life that they both deserve.   There is no way to know at what point the disease will firm its grip on Kinley and Kennedy - we are in a race against time.SOME HOPE - IT'S NOT TOO LATEThere are several treatment clinical trials coming up for both substrate suppression therapy and gene therapy through drug companies, universities, and the NIH.  This Page is a mission of hope for our family and others impacted by GM1 Gangliosidosis, and provides support to ensure these trials and developments continue. We are committed to raising awareness of this horrid disease, and promoting funding for continued research and the advancement of current clinical trials that may eventually be accessible to these children, including our own.  In fact, some believe a cure is imminent - it simply needs the support and dollars to advance.  We are not naive to the fact, however, that clinical trial spots are very, very limited and are experimental, so there are never guarantees...but we do know that our girls do not need to suffer!We intend to soak in every moment with Kinley and Kennedy while they can still run, dance, sing, and just be kids.  We now know how precious each and every day is, and appreciate every time we hear the words “I love you” from them, or hear them sing lullabies to their baby sister.  While continuing to give our girls all the love we can, and show them the world as best we can, we simply must fight to find off-label treatments to slow the progression long enough for a cure to be developed.We will still show them the world, provide experiences even seasoned adults have never had, and make sure every moment they have on this earth is not taken for granted. OUR GOALDeveloping treatments in the United States is notoriously expensive.  For gene therapy specifically, it is estimated to cost between $1,000,000 and $2,000,000 for a single clinical trial participant*.  We are raising $2,000,000 - the conservative estimate for both Kinley and Kennedy to participate in a gene therapy trial.  We refuse to sit idly while our babies bodies slowly betray them and we can only achieve this goal with your support.  Every dollar is immensely important, and sharing the information with your network can and will work miracles.  Reaching this goal won’t guarantee Kinley and Kennedy treatment, but it will go far in advancing the development of the cures we and families in our position so desperately desire.We all say “we will do anything for our children”.  We’re asking for you to help us in this journey so our children and other families in our position can retain hope that there is a better future for our babies.SPECIFIC WAYS TO HELP1)  If you’re in a position to do so, please consider a donation.  Every dollar counts.2)  Spread the word - share to your social networks, email the GoFundMe information to anyone you know, and be sure to ask if your company has a donation matching program!  www.curekinleyandkennedy.org 3)  AmazonSmiles - if you aren’t already supporting a charity of choice, please take a moment to update your AmazonSmiles beneficiary to Cure GM1 Foundation.  After that, shop as you normally do, and a donation will automatically be provided for each dollar spent.  https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=202029360 4)  Forward any leads you may have to support our cause to our Facebook Page or our email address:  https://www.facebook.com/CureKinleyKennedy [email redacted] WHERE IS THE MONEY GOING?Every dollar will benefit the Cure GM1 Foundation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization whose mission is to advance the development of life-saving treatments for GM1.  The Cure GM1 Foundation is currently funding a next generation gene therapy program in collaboration with a world class research team.  The team is headed by Dr. Krystof Bankiewicz at Ohio State University who works in close collaboration with Children's Nationwide Hospital in Columbus, Ohio.  Other initiatives include funding research studies to further drug development, newborn screening, and increasing overall awareness.All donations are 100% tax deductible! *“Novel Financing Approaches Are Needed to Capitalize on Life-Saving Gene Therapies∗.” The American Consumer, The American Consumer Institute Center for Citizen Research, www.theamericanconsumer.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Gene-Therapy-FINAL.pdf.

Ian was admitted to the ICU at White Plains Hospital, where tests and scans identified a large mass in his brain; he was quickly scheduled for emergency surgery to remove a large percentage of the tumor.A few days later, Ian was told he has a Grade IV Glioblastoma (GBM), a rare and aggressive brain cancer, an especially shocking diagnosis for someone Ian's age.The path for treatment will require chemo, radiation, clinical trials, and professional expertise to slow the progression of this terrible disease.At the time the brain tumor was discovered, Ian was not insured and is now reliant on all available aid to face both cancer and the many hospital bills that accompany it.Ian has opened his heart and hands, gaining new loved ones and families as he worked to help others fight their battles, and now he needs our help to fight for him.We believe in Ian, and choose to believe that he will be the exception against this cancer, just as he has been the exception in so many other things throughout his life.

My name is Gregory Arellano and I'm starting this GoFundMe to go to the family of Justin Howell, a fellow Texas State student who was critically injured by Austin Police during protests Sunday, May 31st

Justin was hit by a rubber bullet and has a fractured skull as well as brain damage that, according to his brother Joshua, will lead to an extensive recovery effort. 

The Austin Police Department has already admitted wrongdoing by ""accidentally"" shooting Justin instead of a protester who was close by and  allegedly threw a backpack and/or a water bottle. 

Upon dragging him to the police station as ordered by police, Justin as well as the five other protesters were fired upon by the Austin police department. 

I'm struggling to find the appropriate resources within our state to demand that the Austin police department be held accountable for this, and while I don't know Justin or his family, I do know that he could've easily been any of us. 

The following are words by Joshua over his brother's shooting by police. Please offer whatever assistance you can as we wish for speedy health, recovery, and justice for Justin. 

 

""His name is Justin Howell. And he is my little brother.As this column has argued before, if you really want to know what happened, there is no substitute for the raw, unedited video. In it, you will see five people carrying Justin’s limp body toward police headquarters, begging the officers to get him medical attention. As they do, the police fire some 15 rounds (many of which were at the protesters carrying my brother) over the course of about 30 seconds.“What the f---?” one of them yells.Exactly.Because the five people carrying Justin weren’t “begging” to get him medical attention — at least not in the typical sense. According to Chief of Police Brian Manley in a recent press briefing, the protesters “were given direction to bring [Justin] to the officers” after which the demonstrators “were fired upon with less-lethal munitions as they brought [Justin] towards the officers to get him medical help.”Think about that. It’s unclear whether the officers who shot at the protesters were the same ones who gave them the order to approach. But at minimum, it takes a special kind of incompetence to fire at those who are doing as the police tell them. At minimum, it shows a complete inability to be aware of your surroundings and to manage the situation appropriately.There is no better evidence that here in Austin, Texas, the police are entirely out of their depth.I confirmed Manley’s account with a man named David Frost over Twitter. He was the one who filmed the aforementioned video, and he was able to provide me with another picture of my brother shortly after being hit. In the photo, his body is splayed upon the ground. Onlookers are rushing to his side.In our brief interview, Frost told me that “other protesters were throwing rocks, water bottles, and a backpack. [Justin] was not. The chief of police even said on Facebook live today. They shot the WRONG person.” Indeed, Manley did admit as much during his briefing. But it’s worth considering that this is the world in which we live: If the police tell you something, it’s best to get a second source to confirm its accuracy.It’s also notable in his briefing how little effort Manley puts into taking responsibility for what happened. No, reader, I haven’t omitted the part of Manley’s statement where he seems contrite. There was no apology. Instead, he sat at his desk for three full minutes, gave us the details above and at no point apologized to my brother, my family or the five brave protesters who carried Justin to police headquarters under fire. (To those protesters: My family sees you, and we thank you.)And what is somehow worse, Manley concludes his remarks by saying: “We are praying for this young man and his family and we are hoping that his condition improves quickly. ”To which my family, a deeply religious one, says this: We aren’t interested in your prayers. We are interested in you appropriately using the responsibilities with which the people of Austin have entrusted you. Prayer is not an excuse to abdicate responsibility.And responsible you are. Because Justin won’t be improving quickly. “It will be a marathon, not a sprint,” according to one of his doctors.He has a fractured skull. He has brain damage. Doctors anticipate that when he wakes up, he will have difficulty telling his left from his right.These “less-lethal” munitions are only “less-lethal” by technicality. My brother’s condition shows what can happen when you fire them into a crowd.Earlier this week, the Austin-American Statesman reported that the Austin City Council “will hold an emergency hearing [on Thursday] to address concerns about officer’s response to racial justice protests over the weekend and to address what they see as little cooperation from Austin police leadership to transform policies.”We shall see if anything comes of it. Expect suggestions in a later column.""

He is a loving husband to his wife, Laura, and devoted father to his 7-year old daughter Katherine. Jeff is one of the most genuine people you will ever meet, who always goes out of his way to help others first.A few months ago, Jeff was diagnosed with hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a fast acting cancer that grows in the liver and the spleen and causes unbearably high fevers. He has been relentlessly fighting this horrible disease, but unfortunately the cancer has become resistant to the chemotherapy. His family has consulted with some of the top doctors in Seattle, and the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance (SCCA) hospital is recommending a treatment that will help extend Jeff’s life and hopefully ease some of his symptoms.Jeff’s biggest desire and wish is to spend as much time with his family as he can. Since Jeff won’t be able to work full time and Laura will have her hands full helping Jeff and taking care of Katherine, this fundraiser is to help cover living expenses for Jeff, Laura and Katherine as they make an abrupt move to lovely, but expensive Seattle, as well as ease the family’s financial burdens in the months to come, especially with all the medical bills.Please consider making a donation to this beautiful family. Jeff has so much more life to live with his family and goodness to spread through the community. For updates on Jeff, Laura will post about Jeff’s health journey here: https://www.caringbridge.org/visit/jeffreymcknightYou can also follow the McKnight Lab twitter to support the lab and get updates from Jeff himself: https://twitter.com/mcknightlab_uo?lang=en

She had been scheduled for surgery two weeks after. This past Sunday June 14, 2020,  days before her surgery, ""Juju"" , how we affectionally call her, had to be rushed to the ER with severe pain. While at the ER, further tests were done to find the cause of her pain, and to everyone's unpleasant surprise it was found that her cancer had spread to her liver and lungs.  Giulianna is beautiful woman who had a successful career in modeling and desired a family with kids more than anything.  She became a mother at an early age and later in life, in recent years, she had two more beautiful children. After a series of life events, Juju ended up having to raise her three kids by herself.  In spite of her situation, she assumed her challenge as a new single mom of three with strength, grace, and love. Giulianna considers her kids as her greatest achievement and biggest blessings; these are Cedric (17), Gianna (3), and Cruz (1). Juju is a natural nurturer, a dedicated mother, a loyal friend, with a happy and very sweet personality... we often say, she ""doesn't have a bad bone in her body""! Guiliana's source of strength through all her challenges has been grounded in her strong belief in Jesus as her Lord and Savior and now her Healer. Giulianna's situation is aggravated due to the fact that she does not receive any financial help and had to stop working to continue raising her youngest children. We, Army4Juju would appreciate your donation to provide relief to her and her children with her  needs such as medical bills, childcare, rent, groceries, and special holistic nutrition for cancer. Thank you for your contribution and may God bless you for your generosity.MAMA SOLTERA DE 3 ESTA COMBATIENDO UN CANCER MUY AGRESIVO.Nuestra amiga Giuliana fue diagnosticada Con cáncer de colon a principio del mes de junio del 2020. Se le fue programada una cirugía dos semanas después de su día de diagnóstico. Este pasado domingo, 14 de junio, Días antes de su cirugía, “Juju”, Como cariñosamente le llamamos, fue ingresada de emergencia por un fuerte dolor que conllevó a ciertos estudios que arrojaron como resultado una metástasis de su cáncer a su hígado y pulmones; cosa que nos ha tomado por sorpresa a todos, incluyendo a ella y a sus nenes. Giulianna es una hermosa mujer peruana americana con una previa y muy exitosa carrera como modelo, quien deseaba siempre tener una familia e hijos más que nada. Ella se convirtió en madre a una temprana edad, y más tarde en su vida,  hace unos pocos años, tuvo dos hermosos bebes más. Después de una serie de eventos, Juju se convirtió en madre soltera de sus tres hijos, Y a pesar de su situación  aceptó el reto con amor, fortaleza y gracia.  Giuliana considera sus hijos Cedrick (17), Gianna (3), y Cruz(1) su más grande logro y bendición.  Ella es una madre dedicada y amorosa, proveedora de cuidado y cariño para sus hijos, amiga leal, con una personalidad alegre y muy dulce... siempre le decimos que “no tiene hueso malo en su cuerpo”! La fuente de fortaleza de Giulianna en todos sus tiempos difíciles ha sido su fuerte confianza en Jesucristo como su señor y Salvador, y ahora como su Sanador.La situación de Giulianna se agrava debido a que no tiene apoyo financiero, ya que por estar presente en el crecimiento de sus hijos menores, dejó de trabajar. Nosotros, quiénes nos hacemos llamar #Army4Juju, agradecemos sus oraciones y donación que traerán alivio y provision a las necesidades de  Giulianna y sus niños; necesidades tales como facturas medicas, cuidado de niños, renta, comida, y plan de nutrición especial de ella para el cancer.De parte nuestra y de Giulianna, les damos muchas gracias por su apoyo.Dios los bendiga!#army4juju"

Most of all, however, Lily loves spending time with her parents, Ramela and Jimmy, and her two sisters, Grace (13) and Ella (8). On April 15th, Lily was rushed to Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles with an unrelenting high fever and abdominal pains. Sadly, doctors found a 7 inch mass on her right kidney, with masses in her lungs and lymph nodes. Shortly thereafter, Lily was diagnosed with Ewing’s Sarcoma, an extremely rare and aggressive cancer requiring immediate and intense chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery. Unfortunately, cancer is a word that Lily is very familiar with. In 2011, Lily's maternal grandfather died of breast cancer (sadly, breast cancer occurs in men too). Two years later, Lily's mother, Ramela, courageously fought her own breast cancer battle at the age of 37, while caring for her three young daughters.  And only 3 months after Ramela's last chemo treatment, Lily's grandmother (Ramela's mother) was diagnosed with breast cancer.  There truly are no words to describe how much Lily's family has endured and now this...Lily’s parents are college sweethearts and were married shortly after Jimmy returned from his tour of duty in Iraq. Ramela teaches Art History at Pierce College and Jimmy is a high-school teacher at Holy Martyrs Ferrahian High School.  As you can imagine, this catastrophic event has turned their world upside down. The family is now faced with additional financial burdens and medical treatments not covered by insurance.  As Lily embarks on the fight of her life, her road to recovery will be long.  Unable to attend school, Lily will be spending much of the upcoming year in and out of the hospital.  This fundraiser has been established to help ease the burden on Lily's parents, so that the family can focus all their efforts on Lily’s treatment, healing and spending precious time together.  Anyone who knows Ramela and Jimmy can attest to the fact that they are incredibly giving when it comes to their time, love, and energy for anyone in need.  As the Abbamontians face the unthinkable and do all they can to help Lily beat cancer, if we can help alleviate some of the day to day financial pressures that will mount during this time of critical care, we too will have done our part to support them in a time of sincere need. #HelpLilyBeatCancerWith much gratitude,

On July 8th Adeline went into work for her 12 hour shift in the ER. While she mostly works delivering babies, she was doing a rotation in the ER, treating COVID patients. That morning she went into work feeling well and excited to see patients, but by the evening she began to feel under the weather. What started as intense flu-like symptoms escalated within the week to a hospital stay. Adeline spent the next few weeks battling COVID and was treated with several different respiratory therapies and put on dozens of drugs. When there was no positive response to these methods of treatment Adeline decided to begin an experimental drug trial. However, before we could see if this new drug was effective, her lungs could no longer support her. On August 3rd Adeline was intubated and placed on a ventilator. That night her vitals were unstable and the doctors said that she was not responding well to the ventilator. After consulting with our parents, the doctors took the last remaining step available. At 1am on August 4th Adeline was placed on ECMO, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The catheters used in the ECMO machine involved an invasive procedure to place them in her femoral artery. The ventilator opens her lungs through positive pressure, while the ECMO machine oxygenates her blood. This leaves Adeline’s lungs with the only task of healing themselves. It is projected that Adeline will be on the ventilator and ECMO for at least 6-8 weeks. Since we are from Syracuse, NY, our parents have had to travel back and forth to be there for Adeline and continue to support our family. While our Dad’s job can be done virtually, our Mom’s cannot and therefore she cannot work. In addition, our Mom helps to take care of our 91 year old grandmother, the responsibility of which has now fallen on us. When Adeline gets off life support, she will need physical, respiratory, and occupational therapy to regain her strength and mobility. At this time, we do not know how long a full recovery will take or when she will be able to return to work.Donations made to Adeline’s cause will go toward medical expenses, her bills, travel expenses, and to support the family while we navigate this difficult time.We want everyone to know that Adeline is a fighter. She is determined and has set her mind to surviving this virus. As she fights everyday for her life, we need to stay strong for her on the home front. So much love and support has been shown to our family and from the bottom of our hearts, we thank you.Addendum: Maureen Fagan, the organizer of this GoFundMe, is Dr. Adeline Fagan's sister. Any funds withdrawn from this GoFundMe will be deposited into Adeline's account and will be used accordingly for the purposes stated above.

If not---the short story is that my husband (Jeff) and son (Judge) came within an inch of their lives when they were crushed by a 75 foot red oak tree that fell during a storm in Nashville. Three year old Judge suffered a severe traumatic brain injury and was in a coma for two weeks, all the while being closely and carefully monitored by the heroes at Monroe Carroll, Jr. Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt. Because neither our hometown of Nashville, nor the State of Tennessee offers inpatient rehabilitation for children with brain injuries, Vanderbilt transferred Judge to Children's Healthcare of Atlanta (CHOA), where we have been since May 27th. Jeff shattered 19 ribs, both of his scapulas, punctured a lung, and grotesquely broke his back (sorry, but that's how it was described to us), requiring spinal surgery to both fuse his broken vertebrae and to insert a steel rod. It's nothing short of a miracle that both survived their injuries, and in Jeff's case, is able to use his legs. Because of the global pandemic, cruelly, neither Jeff nor Judge have been allowed visitors during their hospital stays. I've been living with Judge and, mercifully, both hospitals have made a couple of exceptions along the way, so that Jeff could see Judge and I for a short time...but our family having to be apart over the last six weeks with no other visitors has been very tough for us to endure emotionally. Thankfully, Jeff has since moved on to outpatient status and is doing his rehabilitation work at the renowned Shepherd Center in Atlanta, while staying in an apartment nearby the facility. We're incredibly grateful that both Jeff and Judge were able to transfer to two of the top facilities in the country to undergo their rehab work. Once Judge is discharged from CHOA and is ready to begin his outpatient work, we have rented a home where the three of us will finally reunite as a family. What a happy day that will be! Jeff & Judge's doctors have been straight-forward in stressing the long-term therapy and care both will require. We don't know yet how Judge's young brain will heal but doctors have warned us that he may have life-long complications from the severity of his injuries. But we pray for a complete healing everyday, and we are certain that our family (extended to include you) is still living through an active, fluid, and dynamic miracle, that our precious Judge will recover fully, and will live a full and rich life, forever to be known as the boy that took on a majestic red oak, and lived to tell about it! In the few moments Jeff and I have been afforded alone, we've begun to get an understanding of the fallout from this tragedy, both in terms of financial expenses and disruption to our professional lives. We're absorbing the sobering reality that the cost of this unexpected event outstretches the resources we have available. This has been a humbling exercise, and one that has required us to face our hubris, and drop our pride for the good of our family, especially for Judge. We're heeding the advice given by our brother Thad  Cockrell from one of his most inspired songs; ""Pride won't get us where we're going"". Where we're going is home, in every sense of that word...and we need your help in getting there. It takes all the courage we can muster to ask for your assistance, even while knowing that many of you have already offered and many more are willing. It's overwhelming to consider the encouragement, love and support we've already received, and we're awestruck by the grace and generosity provided us daily, both in ways we see, and in ways unseen but felt.   Please know that once we're to the other side of this, a ""Healthy Family Together Again"", and back on firm footing, both physically and financially, we'll repay the charity given us to the life-saving, care-giving, soul-enriching healthcare providers who have nurtured Judge back to good heath, sound mind and strong spirit. We'll forever think of you as we support Monroe Carroll, Jr. Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt, as well as CHOA. Your gifts will be paid forward, but our family will be forever indebted to the angels who, we believe, appeared to us even as that tree began to fall, and will stay with us for time eternity."

The surgical center was founded in 1980 by three board certified OB/GYN physicians that dedicated their careers to providing comprehensive OB/GYN, family planning and reproductive services to women in Kentucky and regionally (Ohio, Indiana, Tennessee, Missouri, West Virginia). Over the years EMW and its physicians have acted as plaintiffs in state and federal level cases against legislation that has attempted to block women's access to care.Since the 1980's EMW has been and remains the training facility for the medical students and OB/GYN residents at the University of Louisville and the University of Kentucky. Patients are referred to the University of Louisville Family Planning Clinic for long acting reversible contraception which can be obtained at no cost.Our StaffAvailable to give patients excellent medical care and provide medically accurate information are board certified OB/GYN physicians that are professors at the University of Louisville, registered nurses, counselor with a training certificate in marriage and family planning, nurse anesthetist's, anesthesiologist, surgical assistants and medical assistants.Who We ServeWomen in the state of KY, Indiana, Ohio and Tennessee, Missouri and West Virginia.Our PartnersACLU,  Kentucky Health Justice Network, National Abortion Federation, Feminist Majority Foundation and Women to the Front.Our partners tackle challenges in many ways from protecting women as they enter the clinic, blocking anti-abortion laws in court, fundraising, subsidizing medical costs and hotels to assisting women with transportation to the clinic.American women are constantly under siege.

This means that Jeff's particular cancer is more difficult to treat and keep under control, as it frequently finds a way to outsmart and become resistant to the treatments. For our friend Jeff, the last 9 months have been a continuous battle, where each new treatment offers a limited reprieve before his cancerous cells multiply and regain strength. Since last October, Jeff has endured a rigorous schedule of dialysis three times a week, chemotherapy treatments a minimum of three times per week, as well as multiple lengthy inpatient hospitalizations. It has been an unrelenting and exhausting battle.Jeff is a self employed clinical psychologist who has dedicated his professional career to helping others. It is now Jeff who is in need of our help. Due to the demand of his therapies, Jeff has been unable to work since last September. Jeff and his wife Leisa have three children, Katie (22) rising senior in college, Kyle (19) rising junior in college, and Jake (17) rising senior in high school. Jeff is the sole source of income for their family.  Though their privacy must be respected, it’s worth noting that with three kids in school, they are selling their home in an effort to continue providing for Jeff’s health care, pay bills, and to support their childrens’ educational wellbeing. They remain in a precarious financial situation with no easy solution.I think it is clear to anyone who knows the Atlases that Jeff is kind, warm, and compassionate, and there’s nothing he wouldn’t do for his family and friends. Jeff and Leisa along with their children have been a staple of the Marvin community for as long as they’ve lived here, always welcoming and essential to so many of our lives. Jeff and Leisa would be making this Go Fund Me for any of us if we were in this situation, so I’m writing to ask that you donate any amount—however small or large—so that the emotional and physical stress of Jeff’s illness won’t be further compounded by financial concerns.**Jeff and Leisa welcome spiritual support in whatever form that may be. Jeff is currently undergoing rigorous preparations for a tandem stem cell transplant in the beginning of August, which if successful, could offer him more precious time with his family and friends. Jeff and Leisa greatly appreciate any well wishes you are able to offer.

“When we meet real tragedy in life, we can react in two ways--either by losing hope and falling into self-destructive habits, or by using the challenge to find our inner strength.”-Dalai LamaAnyone that knows the name Kamil Sudol knows behind that man is great courage, an amazing character, selflessness and a wholehearted soul. Kamil was in a horrifying accident on August 3rd, 2020 leaving his body paralyzed from the chest down as a result of jumping into water he didn’t know was shallow while vacationing in Martha’s Vineyard. Kamil was airlifted to Massachusetts General Hospital where he is in critical condition with fractures to his vertebrae; facing severe injury to his spinal cord leaving his 20 year old body without any sensation and mobility immediately from his chest down, still remaining with some limited sensation in his arms.Kamil was a great athlete at Mahopac High School playing football and lacrosse, and later touched many more lives at Mount Saint Mary College where he continued his Lacrosse career and studied Criminal Justice. Kamil has a monumental love of the outdoors. He loves hiking, biking, fishing, and any sort of adventure. His dreams to become a police officer and have a beautiful life are postponed for now.Kamil will be facing many obstacles and treatments on his way to his desire of recovery. In preparation for the immense emotional and financial toll this will take on his family, we are looking to do everything possible to aid Kamil along his journey. We are asking for any sort of gesture to help him and his family conquer this situation, and participation from you in his long journey. Hopefully we can celebrate one day his regain of what he has lost. If you cannot donate, please pray and please share this in support of Kamil. He is a huge part of our lives and we are hoping to face this with strength, support, and in faith.Thank you so much to The Butkiewicz Family, The Cohen Family, The Moreau Family, Deanna Marano, Paul Brooks (Brooksie), and  Samantha Ann for their help with organizing this campaign; and thank you to those of you that decide to participate in supporting the cause.

Hi everyone :)First I want to thank you guys for all the love and support after my IG post on the 16th. My Leukemia diagnoses was something I was a little nervous to share but it felt odd to keep it away from a community that I feel so close to. 

I was also hesitant to make a gofundme because I have no idea how much this hospital stay or subsequent medical care will but its been encouraging to hear from so many of you encouraging me to do so. Prior to this, I considered my self a pretty healthy person so picking a robust insurance plan as always been more of a second thought (*regrets*). So the goal I set is really just a random guess. 

Whatever is amount donated will go towards medical expenses and keeping things running with the nurselifern media company as I take some time off over the next few weeks or months to recuperate. I appreciate you guys.

-sincerely  a plant

The fire was set at the back of the house, but the damages spread throughout the entire property. This was not an accident. This was arson.This is bigger than just one house. This is about students losing their Jewish home away from home.The UD Chabad Student Board set up this page to start raising money, initiating the love, support and rebuilding even before the Chabad Directors fully processed the loss and figured out the next step forward.This student-led initiative ultimately turned into our official campaign for rebuilding.We, all of us, Rabbi Avremel, Shulie, the Student Board and the Jewish community at UD, feel your embrace and support from around the world. We are so grateful to you and your gift that will rebuild at UD.Thanks to your love, and with the encouragement of our colleagues, layleaders, students and alumni, we are increasing this campaign to $1,000,000 to completely cover the FIRST PHASE of this new home for our students.We can’t replace what was. Someone maliciously burned down this sacred space, “the little blue house,” that grew so many magnificent memories for hundreds of students over the last 20+ years!The little blue house means so much to the students who found inspiration, community, connection, and even love there. Yes, many marriages started out by meeting each other at the little blue house.It wasn’t fancy, it was well worn, lived in, and much loved. It was theirs, and the students thronged there every Friday night. And now, the little blue house is in ashes. The objects and walls that could tell so many tales about Jewish connection and community are no more. Someone destroyed more than the little blue house. They destroyed the walls that held 20+ years of memories, life, and laughter.The little blue house is gone. As we mourn the memories, we must rebuild to create new ones. Like the fabled phoenix, We must rise up from the ashes, stronger, younger, and bigger to live again.For over 20 years, one hundred students would cram in the little blue house. Together we can give them a place to host double that size. Double the memories, double the space, double the laughter.This is what happens when the entire community comes together with a powerful surge of love, support, and togetherness.In the shadow of the fire, and amongst the ashes, a light of unity will shine brighter and much longer than the fire of destruction.Let’s Help Chabad UD Rise Up!-------We wanted to preserve the original plea from this student-led initiative. Here it is below --On Tuesday, August 25, 2020, at around 11 pm a fire was started with intention, at the University of Delaware Chabad. The fire was set at the back of the house, but the damages spread throughout the entire property. Although they tried to salvage what survived, there is not much left. In its entirety, the fire took about three hours to extinguish and while initial estimates put the damages at $75,000 further inspection gave an estimate of $150,00 - $200,000 in damages. No one was present in the home when the fire occurred. Chabad at UD is a home away from home for many Jewish students at the University of Delaware. Each week they open their doors, for Shabbat dinners and other programs such as holidays, celebrations, and learning opportunities. All of this wouldn't be possible without Rabbi Avremel and Shulie Vogel. Their constant generosity keeps students coming back each week. Rabbi, Shulie, and their three children have created a family at UD and have devoted their lives to bettering the Jewish community on campus.This campaign is being run by the students of Chabad, it is the least we can do to kickstart the larger campaign that will be rolled out shortly. Please consider donating whatever you can to help contribute to fixing the damages caused by the fire. All funds will be given to the Vogel Family to rebuild The Chabad House. The little blue house, which we students called home, will be missed, but it is time to give back and rebuild what we have lost.From all of us - Grace Hollander, Haley Levine, Jessica Ehrlich, Sarah Chalmin, Nikki Matza, Louie Gelb, Alex Beigelman, and alumnae Gabby Taubenfeld, and Ariana Marks -  we thank you for your donations to a cause so close to our hearts!

Jake, Jamie (and baby in her tummy) and their toddler son Uriel were on a short trip to their property in Okanogan, WA over the weekend. The property is deep in a rural area with no signal or communication. They were caught in the big Cold Spring Fire on Sunday, we think around midnight . Their abandoned truck was found burned, the fire chased them to the river where they are being rescued today (09/09). They have been through a traumatic incident and will need some financial support!  They have been airlifted to help and all that we know as of now is that they are in bad shape. It is a true miracle of God that they were found and are alive. The whole experience they have been through is nothing short of completely horrific and traumatizing.  They need your prayers!100% of donations will go to Jake and Jamie.

This is Tammie Mabry, My husband is Jakes 1st cousin. I am Jakes cousin-n-law. Jamie is a friend and cousin-n-law through marriage. I am from Maple Valley, WA and started this gofundme to help  relieve the financial pressure knowing they will need every penny to care for their needs. The funds raised for Jake and Jamie will be used for living expenses, a new vehicle since it was burned in the fire, medical bills, and lack of employment due to their injuries and long road to recovery.  Jake and Jamie will be added as beneficiaries. I plan to do this through gofundme by adding Jake and Jamie as the benificiaires and following the instructions on how to do that, so that they can add their bank account and get the funds directly. 

THANK YOU to everyone that has given and prayed. The road to recovery is a long one and we cannot tell you how much we appreciate you and your love for this couple as they heal!

UPDATE!!!! We now have 8 FIRST RESPONDERS WHO’VE LOST THEIR HOME!

My name is Ellie St. Germain and I am the wife toSeth St. Germain who is the Assistant Fire Chief of Grand Lake Fire. The Grand Lake Fire Department has become a family and this tragedy has hit us right in the heart.

This past week has been devastating to many, many families. The East troublesome Fire ripped through the heart of Grand Lake and took homes left and right. Eight of those homes belonged to the first responders that gave all their energy, sleep and time to protect their community against this tragedy. 

Nothing we can say or do will bring their homes back, but what we can do is help get them on their feet and rebuild their future. All proceeds will be split to the 8 first responders who have lost their homes. 

Through this upcoming week, myself as well as other designated members will form a committee specifically for the donations raised for the first responders. Through the committee, we will opena separate bank account with only 2 authorized users (Fire Chief Kevin Ratzmann and Asst. Fire Chief Seth St. Germain) who will disperse all of the funds to the 7 first responders, to use for insurance deductibles, mortgage payments, down payment on a new home, or any other expenses that arise after such a tragedy. 

Thank you so much for your generosity.

A devastating wildfire surrounded the couple's home in the early hours of the morning, and despite the heroic efforts of Chris and Angie, Angie's mother, Peggy, and the couple's 13-year-old son, Wyatt, were killed by the fire. At first, Wyatt was missing and there was hope, but 2 days later he was found in the driver's seat of the family's car with his grandmother Peggy, his dog in his lap and had not survived the Santiam fire. Angie is in critical condition in the burn unit.What we know happened...there were high winds and the power went out and Chris had left to get a generator. Angie awoke to flames surrounding their home. Grandmother Peggy had broken her leg a week earlier and was awaiting surgery. Angie had loaded her mother in the car and by the time she got Wyatt and the animals, the car was surrounded by flames. Knowing it was life and death and there was no way to drive the car out, Angie told her 13 year old son Wyatt and his dog Duke to run. Angie stayed as long as possible to try to get her mother out of the car. but was not successful. She had no choice but to leave her mother, hoping Wyatt would be 10 minutes ahead of her. It was pitch black outside except for flames and smoke and their driveway was very long as was the road back to the main highway.  However, Wyatt did not keep going toward safety, and instead went back to the car and tried to drive his grandmother out of the flames. The road was so hot, it burnt the tires up. He was a heroic boy, trying against all odds to save his grandmother.  All this happened while his father Chris was desperately trying to get back to his family. Blockades had been set up and in desperation he ran the blockades. He found a woman on the road, wearing what looked like a bikini, feet burnt to the bone, unrecognizable. (We later learned the road was so hot she had wrapped her feet with her clothes which had burnt away.) Chris put this woman he did not recognize in the car and said he was sorry but he had to keep going to save his son and wife. Her mouth was black and was not able to speak, but finally whispered ""I am your wife."" After desperate searching, the car was found 2 days later with Wyatt in the driver's seat with his dog in his lap and his grandmother in the car. Angie survived the fire but suffered full-body burns and is currently in critical condition at the burn center in Portland. Her road to recovery will be a long one and will be further complicated by the devastating loss of her mother and child. The couple's home and possessions are gone. The medical costs from Angie's physical injuries will be enormous, plus the funeral expenses for Peggy and Wyatt. Chris and Angie's life will never be the same. While no amount of money can bring back Peggy and Wyatt, our family would be incredibly grateful for any help you can provide. This fund will help Chris and Angie deal with the extreme financial devastation this event has caused. Read more details about the tragic family loss from the devastating Oregon fires in this Statesman Journal story. What happened as told by Capi Lynn of the Statesman Journal Peggy was a devoted grandmother who always had a smile on her face and always had kind words to give. Wyatt was a kindhearted, strong and brave young boy who was fascinated by trains and loved to go fishing. This fundraiser is organized by the Tofte family, Susan Vaslev and Mary Tofte, who are Chris Tofte's aunts and Tyler Vaslev who is Chris Tofte's cousin. Chris and Angie have approved this site as has their family. Funds raised will go directly to Angie and Chris for medical expenses, funeral expenses, expenses during recovery, and replacing everything they have lost. A legal trust account has been created and Chris and Angie are sole beneficiaries of the trust. Peggy with great grandson EzraThe last time cousin Coby saw Wyatt.Wyatt's beloved dog Duke, shown here with his Christmas antlers, was with Wyatt until the end and died in his lap. Happier days with Angie, Peggy and WyattChristmas video from 2013 showing the sweet heart of young Wyatt.

The family, including Cameryn, 13, Bailey, 12, Landon, 10, Sadie, 7, Jackson 5, and Wilson, 3 had just spent two wonderful weeks visiting close friends in Texas.   As they drove down the pitch-dark highway in the middle of what seemed to be nowhere, a tragedy occurred, and they lost control of their vehicle. The Suburban veered from the road and rolled multiple times in a horrific accident that landed it upside down in an area that passing cars could not see them.  The Suburban had been almost entirely crushed, leaving both Brad and Crystal, who is 7 months pregnant, and the family suspended.  Unable to move, Brad was able to use voice command to access his Apple Watch to call 911 for help.  Some of the children were able to release themselves from their seat belts and crawl out and made their way to the side of the road, hoping to find help.  But the parents, Brad and Crystal were unable to remove themselves for over an hour.Help came but, not soon enough for everyone. Even with the help of two Life Flight helicopters and six ambulances, two of Brad and Crystal’s children could not be saved. The couple’s beautiful daughter Bailey, age 12, and their sweet son Landon, age 10, both suffered fatal injuries and are now with the Lord.  Crystal was Life-flighted from the scene taken to the hospital. It took the Jaws of Life to remove Brad from the vehicle and he and the four children were rushed to two different hospitals.The family sustained a seemingly endless number of critical injuries. Brad was left with a fractured face and a broken knee. Cameryn suffered a broken clavicle and severe cuts all over her body. Crystal has suffered a punctured lung, broken ribs, a broken shoulder, and a shattered foot in addition to extreme wounds on her body.  It is a miracle that six of the eight family members were able to walk away from this horrific accident.

Eyewitnesses stated that Rachel was on fire at that time, but rather than jumping herself to safety, she went back in for her daughter Roxanne and sadly, did not return.   Reports say a passerby kicked in the door of an already engulfed apartment and heroically saved Roxxi. Rachel, 30, was a mother, a wife, a sister, daughter, and granddaughter.  She was a beautiful, spirited young woman who always lived life fully and on her own terms. She was the light of her daddy’s life.  She is truly a hero. She made the ultimate sacrifice for her children.

His amazing, loving and kind momma, Wendy Ludwick, just lost her husband to cancer a few months ago.  She is now raising her two children alone, on a school teacher’s salary.  Y’all, she is the kindest and best of us.  Definitely one of our better angels and Gavin did NOT deserve this.  I know the world is haywire right now.  I know the future is uncertain.  But this is where we need to shine and lift up those of us in need.  All the money raised here will go to Gavin’s medical care, therapy, and anything the family needs to care for him, and themselves, as they focus on his healing and rehabilitation. The perpetrator has been arrested.  Thankfully, the attack was caught on a neighbor’s security camera.  However, little Gavin is fighting for his life now and his future is unknown.  He was intubated and some of his very fractured skull removed to allow his brain to swell without further injury.  I am asking, as a mother and human, that you give anything.  One, two, five dollars.  Any little bit is appreciated to help this family face what we know is going to be a long, hard, expensive road ahead.  If you are unable to donate, please consider sharing this post. We are all praying for Gavin to pull through and your prayers are much appreciated, also.  Please.  We’d all hope others would do the same for us if we were in this situation.  I will update as more info comes in on the investigation.  I am grateful for whatever you can give.

Thankfully, he wasn't hit by a vehicle and a passerby saw the accident and was able to call for help. Todd was life-flighted from Park City to the University of Utah where they spent the next 24 hours discovering his injuries. He has broken ribs on both sides, a broken neck, a broken sternum, and most devastating, his back is broken at T7 (below his diaphragm). Consequently, Todd is now a paraplegic. They still haven't been able to assess the damage to his pelvis or knees. As you can imagine, the family is absolutely devastated, afraid, and overwhelmed. This news comes just weeks after finding out they are expecting their 2nd baby, due in May 2021.  Anyone who knows Todd knows he is the funniest, easy-going, honest guy who prides himself on providing and caring for his wife, Jessica, and 3-year-old son Nolan. They have the sweetest love with no lack of healthy banter. They are some of the hardest working people you will ever meet. Jessica is a health care worker for a local children's hospital and Todd a Project Manager for a construction company. He works a very physically demanding job, he loves to build things, is an avid cyclist, and loves doing anything outdoors. This year has been a long one. They purchased a home almost a year ago that needed a complete renovation. Todd worked a full-time job during the day and went to the new house after he got off work and worked late into the night and every weekend getting it liveable for his family, doing most of the work himself. During this time he saw his family very little. They were able to move into their home in June, but they still have several things that were left unfinished. If you know this family, you must also know that they are both fighters. Jess and Todd are both in long-term recovery, and both have more than 10 years sober. Jess is terrified about what their future holds, but she is holding it together for her family. Todd is currently in the surgical ICU with no clear idea of when he will be able to start rehabilitation. At this point, he has had two surgeries and will likely need more. He does have use of his arms, but the broken sternum is preventing him from bearing no more than 10 pounds. The University hospital is not in-network for their insurance and the hope is that once he is out of the ICU he can be moved to an in-network hospital to continue receiving care. The road to recovery is long and the financial strain is overwhelming. Everyone is asking what they can do to help, and right now, the most helpful thing would be for them to be able to focus on his rehabilitation, instead of how they are going to pay for it.  Jess is currently taking unpaid time off because her PTO must be saved to have time off when their baby is born. This money will go directly to the family for medical bills, rehab, and equipment for him as well as equipment to make their home wheelchair accessible, and any other related expenses. Todd's spirits range from joking with the nurses to being absolutely crushed that he may never mow the lawn with his little buddy again. Jess feels the weight of the world on her shoulders right now and I am hoping, with the help of people who are as kind and generous as they are, we can help carry them through this. She never asks anyone for anything and reluctantly agreed to let me start this fund because she never wants to be a burden to anyone. I want to thank everyone who has taken the time to read this. If you can't donate, please share and say a prayer for their family. In an attempt to help alleviate the stress of keeping so many people updated, I will share updates directly from Jess to this page as often as they are available.

Although we surpassed our initial goal, I'm hoping that, as a community, we can reach double the goal. So I ask all of you - if you've not yet done so, use this moment to honor a very unique and wonderful human being. To keep up with Billy's progress, go to https://www.caringbridge.org/visit/billymallon.  It is frequently updated by his partner, Jan.There's a world of us who have learned from and laughed with Billy Mallon, one of the most generous human beings I've ever had the privilege of knowing.While here in New York, Billy sustained a hemorrhagic stroke, paralyzing his right side.  After a prolonged period in intensive care, he is now in acute rehab in New York. The extent to which he will be able to recover is unknown at this time, but we want to have this guy back:Billy Mallon comments on a loving relationship:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn56u-by-D0After discussions with his partner, Jan Shoenberger, Rick Bukata, and Mel Herbert, we decided to create this GoFundMe page. Billy will need a medical air transport back to his home in LA, where he will continue rehab as all of us hope for a substantial recovery.  Such flights cost about $35,000. His home will have to be substantially modified to accommodate his needs, and there will be an ongoing need for aides.He is not the sort to ask for help, but there are so many of us who want to help him anyway. He has enough to deal with without being faced with a mounting financial burden. I am asking all of his friends and supporters to donate to this cause.  I am asking for donations no more than $100 per person.For any funds NOT going directly to Billy, his wish is that funds be donated to the nonprofit fund dedicated to enhancing global emergency care.  He is currently EM:RAP GO Director of Medical Education. This is their mission statement and information:                                           EM:RAP GO Mission Statement""While access to expert emergency medicine has developed rapidly across high resource nations, in many lower resource communities it is still in its infancy.

Our mission is to bring emergency medical education to the world. We invest in the future of emergency medicine by supporting organizations and individuals who are committed to growing the specialty.In 2019 and into early 2020, we advanced our mission through the three-fold initiative of SCHOLARSHIP, OUTREACH and EDUCATION. We sent more than 50 international clinicians to learn and grow with the larger emergency medicine (EM) community at some of the best conferences on the planet, as well as sending out many seasoned faculty to educate in all different parts of the world.As part of our SCHOLARSHIP initiative, we granted scholarships to clinicians from Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Rwanda, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Costa Rica, Peru, Puerto Rico, Argentina, Poland and Mexico, sending them to EM conferences in San Diego, Costa Rica, Chile, New York City, New Orleans, Colombia & Denver.As part of our OUTREACH initiative, we sent faculty to partner, teach and mentor in Kenya, Uganda, Haiti, Guatemala, Chile, Colombia & Costa Rica. As part of our EDUCATION initiative we provided free EM:RAP subscriptions to more than 1,300 clinicians from around the globe in low resource, and often off-the-grid locations.""Thanks to all of you for showing your love and care for a very special friend, physician, educator, and mentor, someone who throughout his career has given so much of himself to others to make them better health care providers, and better people."

Her lifelong dedication to her art inspires us all to be our best selves every day.Jessica met and married her best friend, Tom Bender in 2011, and together they embraced the spirit of entrepreneurship, each in their own successful endeavors.  As a result, both are self-employed and are not part of a larger healthcare plan, another reason your support is so critical.One of Jessica and Tom's deepest desires was to start a family.

On August 9th, while my brother Daniel was on a weekend trip in Lake Sunapee with his friends from Syracuse University, he suffered a tragic injury to his dominant right hand after a wake boarding accident. He was quickly airlifted to Dartmouth-Hitchcock Hospital where he underwent emergency surgery on his hand. Fortunately, the surgeons were able to save his thumb and protect his wound on his palm from becoming infected, however Daniel is left without his four fingers on his right hand. He underwent a second surgery before being discharged and transferred to the Hospital of Special Surgery in New York City. There he will undergo two to three more surgeries to rebuild part of his palm that he lost. After these surgeries, Daniel will have to undergo various therapies to help him adapt to this injury. In addition, Daniel will explore the options of further surgeries for the reconstruction of the hand and fingers and/or prosthesis. Daniel is a 20 year old Syracuse University Student in the Visual Performing Arts department studying acting. Daniel is from Sea Cliff, NY on Long Island and has always had an active life growing up. He has played many sports, performed in plays at his local theater group, and has been involved in various charity events on Long Island. Daniel attended the Waldorf School of Garden City growing up, and afterwards the Long Island Lutheran High School. At Syracuse, he is a apart of the fraternity Psi Upsilon where he’s involved with various philanthropic events.Daniel has always been an inclusive, helpful and well-liked human being. He’s always made a positive impact on anyone he meets. He has always been very determined with any task that’s been set before him including this difficult situation he has been faced with. Everyone who knows Daniel knows that he will without a doubt be able to push himself through this injury, but unfortunately he will not be able to do so without incurring numerous medical expenses. Daniel has always cared deeply for his family and has been worried about the medical costs for rehabilitation since his tragic injury. To help Daniel not be mentally burdened with the thought of paying for his medical bills, we are asking the public for their support. With your support not only will you help our family make sure that we can afford anything that Daniel needs to make a recovery, but you will also allow Daniel to completely focus on his rehabilitation so that he can take his next step forward in life and his career.

I know Michael both as a dear friend and as the Founder of The 6 Foundation, a Non -Profit Sports and Cognitive Rehab facility for First Responders located in Santa Rosa, California. You can read about us at www.thesixfoundation.com.  Michael Musgrove is one of the most genuine people you'll ever meet. There is not a moment that I haven't seen a smile on his face or a hand reaching out to help. What blows my mind is... he's lost more in his life than most of us could fathom, a child and on the one year anniversary of her passing, his home. And even still ... he continues to fight for others. This morning, I learned about the loss of his dream property. Mike, his brother Sean, and a close family friend Natasha, had saved for and acquired this foreclosed home in hopes to raise his remaining daughter  in the country and with family....  The first thing he said was,  ""Do you think we can use my story and help others?"" Three structures in total were destroyed. Michael's property burned to the ground while he was evacuating elderly and performing structure protection during the Glass Fire. He was set to be insured within days and had just purchased this foreclosure, his dream, 48 hours before it was destroyed. He has fought on all our (N. California's major wild land fires). He now finds himself, and this tribe, and all of their children with a shattered dream and a nightmare. Mike will be directly withdrawing any and all funds donated from GOFUNDME and using it for rebuilding these structures. BEFORE:AFTER:The uninsured damage loss is 1.5MM in cleanup and rebuild of the 3 home property destroyed. Would you join me in rebuilding this Firefighter's legacy?"

On July 17, 2020 Carlos Garcia (a beloved father) passed away due to oxygen deprivation he was found unresponsive and after many attempts the hospital staff could not bring him back.He was a great person and had the most love for his boys Nathan and Isaiah. Nathan and Isaiah recently suffered a tragedy on July 2, 2020 when their Mother passed away due to Covid-19, now with the passing of their father they are left with no parents. (Which is so heartbreaking) The money being raised will be for their living expenses and anything they may need. This Go Fund Me was originally created for Funeral Expenses for Carlos however, at the last minute we received a very generous donation that helped pay for all Funeral Expenses! Thank God !  I just want to thank each and everyone of you in advance and tell you that the family greatly appreciates you in our time of sorrow.  

Update:My name is Daniel Esquivel I’m uncle to Nathan and Isaiah. The GoFundMe expenses are for them.

For anything they may need, to make sure we are able to give them the life they deserve after enduring such tragedy of losing both parents. The funds will pay for any medical (since Isaiah was born with a heart problem) , school and legal expenses, Which we have great news !! 

Jacob and Isabel have been given FULL/PERMANENT custody of Nathan and Isaiah ! PRAISE JESUS !! 

The funds will be managed by  my brother Jacob Mendoza, my mother Rita Marquez-Mendoza and myself Daniel Esquivel. Any cashiers checks or money orders will have a memo with Living expenses for Nathan And Isaiah. And proof will be provided with receipts on what it was spent on. Thank you

The Free Thinker Project is a 501(c)(4) non-profit organization committed to bringing unheard truths to communities of people that have been misled by the Left and the mainstream media for decades. I am also a freshman at the University of Alabama and longtime conservative activist. As we approach the 2020 Presidential election in November, the Democratic party has made their position on law and order clear. They do not support it. As violent mobs burn our cities and destroy our businesses the left either sits back and watches or joins in themselves. This recent Anti-American outbreak from the Black Lives Matter organization and Antifa has left police departments across the country defunded and in ruins.  The institution of the police force is part of what allows this country to be great. These men and women risk their lives so we can sleep in peace at night, but how does the left repay them? By making it nearly impossible for officers to support their families. That is why The Free Thinker Project will be launching this “Refund the Police” fundraiser in support of our law enforcement. In the coming weeks, we will work to identify departments across the country most in need of our support. We will help the departments in whatever way is needed, and all proceeds from this fundraiser, apart from administrative costs, will go directly to the departments.  This year we are in a fight for our country, a fight for our lives. The left wants anarchy, but we need law and order. That is why I am asking you to partner with me and DONATE to this GoFundMe to help Refund the Police!

— Andy Ngô (@MrAndyNgo) August 17, 2020I'm Brian Haner. Just moved to Apache Junction AZ two weeks ago .  Adam Haner's is my little brother. He's living in Portland, I was right across the river from him in Vancouver WA before I moved. Hoping this money will help Adam get things together for his life after the attack he suffered. I know he will need repairs, or to replace the truck that was wrecked. He is going to need time to recover from his injuries as well. Plus replace things that where stolen from his pick-up that night, on Aug 16th. which happens to be my birthday. His girlfriend had some help getting his truck towed home while he slept tonight, Aug 17th. Maybe he will use some of this money to move out of Portland, or just use it to move up. I really don't care what he uses it for. He would give the shirt off his back to help any of the people around him, and he really didn't deserve what happened to him in Portland. I'll supply updates here as I can, and may update the 'story' on the GFM to better detail how this will all get handled. I really through this up in a hurry, because I was getting so many messages to start the GFM for him. After spending most of my day looking for information on what happened to him, and letting my mom and family know he was alive and home, I started replying to all the DM's and messages on social media, and started this GFM and replied to as many massages as I could. I currently have enough free time in Arizona to mostly keep up with something this demanding. So hopefully, I'll get to reply to all of you that have question, want proof it's really for Adam, and get you updates as there is information available. Huge Thank You to everyone showing him support. This is going to be an awakening experience for my brother in so many ways. He's always been cynical about the world at large, but has always been someone willing to step up and speak up to help someone being treated unfairly.

We were shocked and heart broke when we heard the news of our friend Sravya Kalepu (Austin, TX ) left us on September 19th, 2020 6:00 PM on West Pamer Lane Austin, TX during a collison between bicycle and truck. Sravya is very talkative, energetic, hard-working, motivated, always cared about others. She tried very hard to fight for life but unfortunately she had a cardiac arrest during the incident. 

Sravya does not have any immediate family in the United States, her family is in India (Vijayanagaram, Andhra Pradesh, India). We are organizing this fund to initiate the last rights of Sravya and also sending her mortal remains back to her home. 

There are no words to express about the huge loss of our beloved friend. We ask you to please support Sravya's family during this hard times. 

We appreciate all your help. Please share & support. 
Rest in Peace Sravya! You'll be remembered forever!

Chris was a loving a husband, a proud father, and a doting grandfather. He was also a talented veteran stuntman, a member of ISA, a Tae Kwon Do black belt, an exceptionally loyal friend for all those he met, and was hilariously funny. There was never a dull moment when Critter was in the room. He loved California, surfing, walking his dogs, riding his motorcycle, Kim’s cooking and their collection of lunch boxes. He was an incredibly rare person and the world went darker without him in it. He and his beautiful family have always been the kindest people, keeping their home open to all who wanted company or needed help. We can’t alleviate their pain, but we can help them out financially in the worst time of their lives.Chris, Kimmie, Wyatt, Tyler and Nova, we love you. 





About this fundraiser and the organizers: 
We live in Studio City CA. We have been close friends to the Carnel family for over a decade and Rene worked closely in the stunt business with Chris. We set up this fundraiser to ensure that these wonderful people won’t have to worry financially in those terribly trying times. All proceeds will be directly transferred to Kim Carnel, Chris’ wife, to use as she chooses. 
Thank you to this wonderful community "

He received a phone call from the Sutton volunteer fire department around 7AM saying that all of his harvest equipment was on fire. This included a combine and corn head, a tractor, and two semis.  What makes this so unusual is the early morning timing and the fact that all of his equipment was parked away from each other.  Our family wants to take care of the resources we have been blessed with.  We want to finish harvesting our remaining acres and fulfill our grain contracts.  We want to provide for our families.  And most of all, we want to continue farming another four generations.I am setting up a fund  to cover the insurance deductible, the rental of equipment to finish the 1,000 remaining acres (approx. $30k just for the combine & head), and any expenses not covered by insurance.  Thank you in advance for your generous out pouring of love and donations.  The family is moved by the encouragement they have received on Facebook, from phone calls, text messages, and personal visits.                                                                        Sister of a Nebraska farmer

We had discussed all of the many possibilities of her bright future  and the limitless paths she could follow.Charlotte was born under unique conditions she was delivered via C-section, 4 weeks prior to her scheduled due date. We were expecting to receive her November 20th 2020. But we experienced a great opportunity to embrace her sooner. Charlotte is a premature baby due to the strenuous circumstances her mother encountered during the third trimester.On October 20th, 2020 Chaniece doctors informed us that she was developing symptoms of preeclampsia. From this day to Oct 22, 2020 my wife Chaniece had to endure surgery due to complications developing in her body. Three of the main challenges we encountered were a ruptured liver, high blood pressure, and kidneys were not fully functioning.Chaniece fought with every piece of strength, courage, and faith she had available. She was a Chief Resident at Indiana University School of Medicine Pediatric Hospitalist with Indiana University Health Physicians and just completed her board exams while interviewing for multiple positions around the country. Chaniece was  such a warm soul, welcoming to almost everybody. Not only loved by family and friends but individuals she would encounter in the patient population. She had a special way of being empathetic with her patients and making each one of them feel special.Charlotte is absolutely beautiful!  She has been in the NICU since birth but she is doing exceptionally well.Although we have encountered the loss of a wife and a mother, Charlotte and I rejoice in having one another and knowing that Chaniece is watching down on us from heaven. This road will not be an easy road for Charlotte and myself, but we are trusting in the name of the Lord!  We understand there is a great expected end ahead but there is also a financial  need to secure that great expectation. We are grateful for any heartfelt contributions during this time.Chaniece although you are not with us physically, I will always carry you in my heart and share my wonderful memories of you with our daughter Charlotte.

He has a passion for friends, family and music, recently having started his own Record label, Modern Static Records. While participating in an annual charity event, on February 2, 2020, Travis suffered a severe spinal cord injury at the C5 and C7 levels, leaving him paralyzed from the chest down. He underwent multiple emergency surgeries, before being classified as a quadriplegic.   As the Covid-19 Pandemic hit with full force, Travis was prematurely pushed out of his NYC rehabilitation center and as a result, he has not had the opportunity to gain proper physical rehabilitation nor counseling to deal with the emotional and mental impact of his paralysis. Since the onset of the pandemic, Travis has remained in his Long Beach, NY apartment, where he is cared for solely by his loving girlfriend, Ilana, and mother, Lynn. Travis will have many expenses going forward, including a handicap-accessible van to transport him to therapy/appointments, a motorized wheelchair, and an in-home aid. Some other expenses include physical and occupational therapy, doctor visits, medical supplies/equipment, home renovations and potential experimental therapies and treatments. Suffering a near-fatal and life changing accident in the midst of a pandemic has not managed to break Travis’ spirit. His adaptability, hopefulness and perseverance have inspired everyone who knows him. We would appreciate your help in making this journey just a little bit easier for Travis.All money raised will be going to the Travis Gentile Supplemental Needs Trust.

He went unconscious, has a deep wound on the back of his head, experienced immense bleeding. The paramedics arrived within 15 minutes and transported him to Danbury Hospital where they sedated and intubated him, and a neurosurgeon performed life saving surgery to help with the large amount of swelling that was/is occurring in his brain.His vital signs are stable, he is in the ICU, but he has a very severe brain injury. He is in a medically induced coma. He will be airlifted to Yale-New Haven Hospital when he is stable enough to do so. There they'll take care of him in the neuro-ICU. We are hoping for the absolute best, while the surgeon has communicated to prepare for the worst.We are here as a family with him, sending up all our prayers, giving him all of our love, and asking for all of your support as well. Liam is a fighter with so much energy. He will push to get through this.The brass tacks: Liam does not have health insurance. He's made several attempts to get health insurance over the past year and it never went through. The cost to take care of him will quickly add up.Liam was a volunteer firefighter for 10+ years, graduate of Newtown High School and Eastern Connecticut State University. He is a firecracker, an Energizer bunny, a ""pissa"", the funniest person we know. He loves to ski and golf. His love language is acts of service - he'd do anything for his people.This is the fight of Liam's life. We cannot even start to fathom what it would be like to live without him.

He was airlifted from Jackson, WY to Idaho Falls later that evening for spinal realignment surgery. Prognosis is that he will not be able to walk again. We remain hopeful that this is worst case scenario and that Pierre, being a strong individual physically, mentally, and spiritually, will gain the strength needed to overcome this injury and regain the use of his legs. An avid snowboarder, mountain biker, and all around lover of the outdoors, this will change every aspect of his life drastically. Sometimes it seems as though the worst things happen to the best people. 100% of funds raised on this platform will go directly to Pierre, as he has a long road to recovery ahead.

While Project Walk is one of the best facilities in the country and is only about 30 miles from home, it does not accept insurance. Scott's journey will be long and challenging but with the strength of everyone behind him, we are very hopeful and optimistic about his recovery. Many of you have reached out throughout this most difficult time and asked how you can help.    It is with a humble heart that we are asking, on behalf of the Saums, for your support to help Scott  get back in action.   With the true cost of his injury as yet unknown, we do know that many accommodations need to be put into place.  Household modifications along with outpatient therapies will be costly, but invaluable and essential for his best possible recovery.  All monies donated will be put into a trust established specifically to cover out of pocket costs for Scott's recovery.We thank you for being part of #Strong4Scott during this most challenging and complicated time. Thank you all in advance. We love you.Karen Gilmour and Terri Lee TL

Everything my parents, Caryn Fried, 72 and Wayne Reynolds, 81 have worked so hard to build over the past 40 years has been reduced to ash and rubble. If there has ever been a time for funding and support from the wider community, this is it.For us, this loss is monumental.  Aside from all the things we personally cherish, we lost my parent’s life’s work, as well as both arms of our family business.  We are so grateful to discover, that a few of my mother’s sculptures have survived that were outside of the structures. This is a huge comfort to us.  All of our pottery and paintings, ceramics equipment, and our beloved Christmas tree farm are gone, meaning my parents have now lost all sources of income for the foreseeable future. 

With a devastation of this magnitude, the best insurance we could acquire does not come close to covering this loss.  We want to plant seeds - both literally and figuratively- to grow our business again. It is mindblowing to understand what goes into a physical business. It would take 7-10 years before a new grove of trees could mature for harvest.  The inventory of pottery in our gallery took years for my parents to create.  We need to safely clear the property of the remains of our 5,000 burnt trees, our studios, destroyed equipment, pottery and building rubble, and our home. We estimate needing upwards of $100,000 beyond our insurance coverage to begin to do this work and start the process of rebuilding our lives. Our Phase 1 GoFundMe goal, while we continue to assess damages and wait for more information from our insurance company is $150,000.  If 1,000 people could donate $150 we could do it, or 2,000 people donating $75.  If you are unable to donate, you could also help by sharing our link in an email to your network or reposting on social media. I would like to share some of my parent’s history.  Their life is their craft, and their rural countryside destination, a natural sanctuary for many.  My parents got their start living in an Oakland warehouse, selling their pottery on the streets of San Francisco. In the 1970’s they mastered their craft under Marguerite Wildenhein at Pond Farm Pottery among the Armstrong Redwoods. Since, they have made Sonoma County their home.  In 1987 Caryn & Wayne purchased their property along Highway 12, on the outskirts of Santa Rosa, and this is where I grew up.  Over the years, my parents created a unique destination where they have shared their artwork and taught the craft of making pottery. The purchase of the property brought with it a Christmas tree farm.  With the support of master arborist Gary Muerle, we cultivated the forest adding 10 varieties of trees from redwoods, to cedars, firs, and pines.  We utilized sustainable practices to allow our trees to regenerate and regrow.  Our pottery and “choose-and-cut” tree farm has hosted families for multiple generations.  Sharing the holiday with us has been a Sonoma County tradition. We are profoundly grateful for all the years of patronage from our students and clients these past four decades.  As a family, we have truly lived our dream and just can’t believe it’s over. The future is now quite uncertain for us. But we’re not giving up on Santa Rosa, we’re not giving up on Sonoma County, and it is simply impossible to give up on art. Thank you for your continued support in the days ahead. Thank you to the many, many people who have reached out offering us support, love and encouragement; we need our community now more than ever. We offer our deep gratitude in advance for the generosity of friends, family and strangers in our time of need as we begin our journey of rebuilding and healing our land and our family. WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR ANY AND ALL CONTRIBUTIONS.Thank You,Caryn, Wayne & Maya

Words cannot express our gratitude. Miracles have occurred in my dads situation and everything the doctors have been telling us from the beginning has been devastating but he has the strength of a Lion as most of you may know so he’s pushing! Unfortunately the road to recovery is very long and costly and he’s relying on all of us. 

Shlomi’s story:
On June 6th 2020 Shlomi had a hard time breathing and was admitted into the hospital with ARDS caused by COVID-19. He immediately was put on the ventilator and was put into an induced coma. Being in critical condition and given a 5% chance of surviving, he struggled with multiple infections, kidney failure, lung failure, blood clots, and many other obstructions. At the hardest point he was on 100% oxygen from the machines and that was almost not enough to keep him breathing. He pulled through and 2 months later woke up. He since then has been doing dialysis daily and oxygen reliance from machines has been decreasing slowly. He recently tested negative for Covid and is starting to rebuild his strength. His battle is far from over with multiple types of rehabilitation needed. Once off the ventilators (God willing sooner than later) he will need to be immediately moved from Kaiser to a rehab facility that does dialysis, physical therapy, and speech therapy in house. Unfortunately his health insurance doesn’t cover this type of facility and we are seeking out for your help. 

We are beyond blessed to say that he is now in recovery mode and has beaten the worst parts of this virus. These are the tough times we are reaching out for your help. His long journey is just now beginning.

Prayers come first and contributions second.We are going to need all the help we can get and greatly appreciate anything you can contribute. 

Again, thank you everyone for everything your blessings will help my dad recover. 


Thank you everyone for your blessings and donations today is Shlomi’s 96th day in the hospital ❤️❤️❤️ 9/11/2020

On Sunday May 31st, amidst the riots happening in Santa Monica, our beloved pharmacy was looted and ransacked starting at 2pm. Looters broke the picture window next to the door, destroying all they could get their hands on, as they were looking for hard drugs, money and computer equipment.  As the day progressed, streams of looters came in and out of our pharmacy carrying their “spoils”.  They continued to break a few more windows, pushed over the probiotic refrigerator, broke doors, ripped open cabinets that were locked, stole computers, cash drawers and the like.  During this crisis, a few or our staff members along with a few loyal customers stood outside our door, trying to keep out more looters. In addition, Steve Litvak was jumped by 3 men and beaten while he was trying to keep more looters from entering the store. Thank GOD he is ok! Thank you all for your heroism! Although inside our pharmacy is a disaster with smashed glass shards, damaged products, ruined carpets, pieces of shelving units thrown everywhere and even products thrown in the bushes outside, we are resilient!  We love serving our community because we consider our customers as part of our family. It is important to us that we get up and running as soon as we are able. We are doing our best to do this in a timely manner. We thank you for all your support and we look forward to seeing you all soon.

I am trying to raise money for my uncle's (Jose Tamay) business - El Sabor Chuchi . Last night during the Lake Street riots following the murder of George Floyd, his business was vandalized, and three large store windows were shattered and his store was looted. This isn’t the first time that Jose’s business has been broken into, his store was robbed and looted just a few weeks ago while shut down due to COVID-19. See news story below:News Story Also, last year in June, Jose hired someone to install a new exhaust hood in his restaurant location, but the man who was to install it, disappeared. Jose lost $15,000 cash. Jose sued, he won the court case, but almost a year has passed and he hasn’t received any money.Jose is a really hard working man who works 7 days a week, 13 hours a day, from 8am to 9pm. He does everything he can to provide for his wife and two kids. Being an immigrant, Jose doesn’t have access to bank loans or stimulus money. All the money used to create his business was saved from working long hours as a cook/dishwasher.Raising money for Jose is important to me because he has worked so hard to create two small, successful businesses and always has a positive attitude despite many setbacks. He is such an inspiring and amazing person, and it's really hard to see him get knocked down so many times.As a part of the International Baccalaureate (IB) education track I am enrolling in, community involvement is an important part of my education. I am particularly passionate about the plight of immigrants. Through this fundraiser, I hope to spread awareness of how much immigrants are both directly and indirectly targeted and taken advantage of. Please help me show kindness to some of our city’s most vulnerable citizens.Your donation will go directly to Jose and his family to help replace three broken storefront windows and to recoup a portion of his losses. In addition, your financial support will provide a much needed sense of security and community to this family. Please share with your friends and family even if you are unable to donate.

Our father had spent hours with his employees preparing the store in order to ensure the safety of his employees and customers, and despite his own health issues which put him at high risk, he decided that it was important to open up his store to support not only his livelihood but his employees’ livelihoods as well. On May 30th, all of that effort, and the efforts of a lifetime were destroyed by looting, while our dad helplessly watched for hours from the security footage on his phone. Our father opened his small business in Chicago’s South Side 30 years ago after immigrating from Korea to America with absolutely nothing. Englewood Beauty Supply was more than a business, and over the decades it became a fixture in the neighborhood, with relationships built with community members. Our father had worked tirelessly and relentlessly without taking days off, working almost 365 days of the year so that he could support our family without complaint and serve as the best example to his children of positivity and the value of hard work. This is not the first setback that our parents have faced. In 2007, when our home was destroyed by lightning, the store was a source of hope, a way to rebuild, and start again. Our father’s same positivity, strength, and heart that he put into his store helped us rebuild our home over the years.  It breaks our hearts to see how defeated they are this time, and we would like to give them hope as they rebuild again. The world is hurting and we understand that this was a result of the hurt and the need for change.  We empathize with the outrage that has come from the lack of change and unjust treatment of the black community, and we stand by our community and those who are suffering. We also know that our parents are hurting, and it will be a long road of recovery and healing. Unlike large businesses, our small business insurance does not cover the entire cost of damages and stolen goods. We are humbly asking for support in rebuilding our parents’ business and thank you from the bottom of our hearts. Sincerely,Bradford and Grace ChongIf you wish to donate directly please email [email redacted].  You'll receive an auto-reply with more information on how you can make a direct donation.Edit/Update**This morning at 6:30am (Wednesday, June 3rd), we received a call from a neighboring business that our building was on fire.  Our father headed over to see the damage, and it was devastating. We are at a loss of words and unsure how to move forward. We are asking for support during this time as the costs for repair are unimaginable and devastating. Our father's livelihood and everything that he has worked for as an immigrant for the past 30 years has been stripped away from him. We ask for any support possible and prayers as we try to recover.Before Fire:After Fire:How is the GoFundMe organizers related to the recipient of the funds?We are this small business owner's (Sung Min Chong and Kyung Sook Chong) children, Bradford and Grace Chong. How will the funds be used for this campaign?The funds will be used to lessen the impact and recover from the lost merchandise (stolen and damaged by fire), cash, and computers(3) and the damage to windows, glass cases/displays, shelves, walls, printers, cash registers, and security system.

She was immediately rushed to Trauma Center at SF General Hospital and had surgery within 24 hours. She impacted her C4-C7 vertebra, causing partial paralysis in her extremities. Marcy has limited mobility in her shoulders, arms, and left leg, and these areas continue to show very modest improvement. At present, she can not move her fingers. The weeks and months ahead will be instrumental in her recovery. Given the nature of her injury, Marcy will then require extensive physical therapy for at least the next year. On September 12th, Marcy was moved to the premier rehabilitation facility in the Bay area, the Santa Clara Valley Medical Center.  Our family was elated that she was accepted at this facility because it is “out of network” from her current medical provider.Ron, her partner of 12 years, is determined to provide the best medical support for Marcy but now finds the prospective cost to be daunting. Over the next 6 months we will need the following:1.    In-Home Stairlift ($20,000)2.    Handicapped-Accessible Van ($35,000).3.    Electric Wheelchair ($3,000)4.    At Home Physical Therapy and Nursing Care ($125,000).No one could have predicted these events. Prior to the accident, both Ron and Marcy’s income had been reduced significantly because of COVID which makes the need to raise funds even more acute.Marcy has an indomitable spirit; some would say a je ne sais quoi.  She is incredibly kind-hearted and thrives with adversity. So many of you have already reached out to help and we sincerely hope you can aid in her recovery by contributing.All funds will go directly to Marcy’s medical costs and continued recovery. Many Thanks From Marcy's Family, Alexandra, Hannah, Ron, and Madeline

On May 7, 2020, the City of Chicago lost one of the finest men to ever wear the CPD Uniform when Todd's life was tragically cut short.  Todd served our city as a Chicago Police Detective, and was a devoted husband and father of two beautiful children. As the sole provider, he worked tirelessly for his family and was attempting to provide financial security for their future. Unfortunately, now their financial situation is very uncertain. To know him was to love him, and his caring and generosity has touched the hearts of many throughout our neighborhood and beyond. We would like to do our best to payback his generosity by supporting his family in their time of need. Todd is no longer here to provide for his family, and his friends have now come together to start this campaign in order to ease the financial burden they must endure alone. The money raised from this fundraiser will go towards the education of Todd's high school aged children, who will be attending college shortly, and to assist his wife, Regina, with household and living expenses.  Please forward this on and share with your friends and family so we can reach this goal and help finish what Todd started. Thank you for your support

He has been treated and released to recover at home. He will have more surgeries in the future to continue his healing process.Gia sustained much more serious injuries. She has many broken bones and has undergone numerous surgeries to repair her body. She will need more surgeries as her body heals. She is currently in the Trauma ICU and only allowed one visitor a day which is either Danny or her mother, Andrea Sueing.This accident comes just one year after Gia donated her one of her kidneys to her son, Noah. Gia, giving her son life not just once, but TWICE! Read the powerful story here.Gia is in for a very long recovery. For anyone who knows her, you know she has already started fighting. Fighting for strength, fighting to heal, fighting to go home. Our Gia is already ready to dance again.But she won’t be going home yet. Gia has 2-3 more weeks in trauma ICU and more surgeries before she can be moved to a rehabilitation facility. This is not going to be easy for any of the Broadways.BUT…we know Gia Is Able and God Is Able. Notice how both of those things spell Gia? We know God is the ultimate healer, and we pray for her full recovery. We also know Gia doesn’t quit and likes things done right. She WILL excel at this recovery.When Gia finally does return home, there will be many needs as she continues to recover. This Go Fund Me has been set up by ‘Friends of the Broadways’ to help with those needs. Mainly the family will need, and we hope to help cover the costs of:·      A bedroom and bathroom to be built downstairs in their house·      A ramp added to the entrance of their home·      A vehicle that has a lift·      Support with medical bills·      Funds for anything the Broadways need during Gia and Noah’s recovery.What the family needs most right now are prayers. Prayers for Gia, Noah, Danny, Joshua, and Nile. Please keep Andrea Sueing, Gia's mother, Brooke Gray, Gia's sister, and Bennie Wilson, Gia's grandmother (all pictured below) close in your thoughts and prayers.  We have set up an email address ([email redacted]) where you can send the family prayers, well wishes, or just let them know you are thinking about them. Please know someone is saving all these for the family to read but will not be responding.Gia and Danny both work at St. George’s Independent School. He is the artist in residence at the Upper School that houses 6th-12th grade and Gia works as the music teacher at the Germantown Campus for PK-5th. Gia’s love for her students shines through in everything she does. She knows every child is a child of God and treats them as such by setting high expectations and helping them reach it.

Obituary
Michael David Dessino, 29, of Bloomsburg and formerly of Middlesex, New Jersey, wrestled his last match on June 1, 2020, after a horrific car accident. He was born on September 19, 1990 in Plainfield, New Jersey, to Michael and Denise (Goniea) Dessino of Middlesex, New Jersey. He married Katrina (Conrad) Dessino on August 30, 2019 and they were expecting their first child, Dominic, in September. 

Mike was a 2009 graduate from Middlesex High School, where he was a standout wrestler. He was a region 3 champion, three-time district champion, three-time state qualifier and two-time state place winner, placing 8th as a sophomore and 4th as a senior. Mike finished his high school career with a record of 145-22 with 98 victories by fall. He would later be inducted into the Blue Jay Hall of Fame in 2015. 
Following high school, Mike attended Bloomsburg University where he earned a Bachelor of Arts in anthropology and a minor in criminal justice in 2014. He wrestled for the Huskies from 2009-14, where he posted a 105-43 career record and ranks second in program history for career pins with 45. He was a three-time NCAA Division I national qualifier, three-time PSAC champion, and won the 2011 EWL title at 174 pounds. Mike’s 105 victories are 15th on the school's all-time list, while his three PSAC championships made him one of only ten grapplers in the program's history. Following his collegiate career, Mike served as a volunteer assistant coach for two seasons for the Huskies and had a brief run as a mixed martial arts (MMA) fighter. He went 4-0 as an amateur, picking up three of his wins over a six-month span in 2015 and his last victory in September of 2017; three of his wins came by submission. 

Mike was a corrections officer at The United States Penitentiary, Lewisburg, and could be caught playing video games daily, eating gummy worms, or wrestling his fur baby, Jaxon. He loved playing paintball with friends, listening to podcasts, hiking, and going to the gun range. Mike was very computer savvy, building his own computer, and enjoyed cooking, especially making his grandma’s homemade pasta sauce. He was known for his love of Batman, Jeep Wranglers, the New York Giants, the New Jersey Devils, fishing and crabbing. Mike had a heart of gold and was described by everyone as loving, caring, loyal, patient, and humble, with an infectious smile that could light up any room. 

Along with his wife and parents, he is survived by two sisters, Brittany and Giovanna Dessino, nieces Lacey Dessino and Isabella Santos, maternal grandmother Ellen Goniea, in-law’s David and Marisa Conrad, grandparent in-laws Philip and Barbara Miccio, brother-in-law Brandon Conrad, and sister-in-law Cheyenne Conrad. Mike is also survived by many loving aunts, uncles, cousins and friends. Mike was preceded in death by his paternal grandparents Stephen and Beatrice Dessino, maternal grandfather David Goniea, grandparent in-laws Lucien and Janet Conrad, and his golden retriever, Sawyer.

Mike’s life was a blessing to all who knew him, and he will be greatly missed by his wife, family, friends and the entire wrestling community.

A memorial service will be announced at a later date. Family and friends may send online condolences to bunnellfuneralhome.com.

Monan’s Rill is a historic, intentional community in Sonoma County whose intergenerational members hold a shared commitment to the land, to core community values, and to one another. For over 45 years, the 414 acres of land have been  lovingly stewarded by individuals, couples, and families, and the land has been their beloved home. The recent Glass Fire wreaked devastating losses to Monan’s Rill. The fire burned hot and fast through the property on Monday morning, and destroyed 12 of the 13 homes, along with the barn, greenhouse, garden sheds, water pump, and power poles. The only home left standing was handbuilt by two of the founders, Russ and Mary Jorgensen, longtime activists who were part of the hundreds of Freedom Riders who did jail time in the South during the early 60s for refusing to comply with segregated bus seating.  In addition to this one home, Monan's Rill's community building, shop with tools and equipment, and recently installed rainwater catchment system and solar array are still intact. These will be the seeds of a beautiful rebuilding of the community, but there is so much to rebuild, and the people of Monan's Rill need our help.

There will be a very large gap between what insurance will cover and the real financial cost of recouping and rebuilding from this catastrophic loss. Many families evacuated with little more than the clothes they were wearing.  Several newer families who were renting houses on the land lost everything and do not have rental insurance. Everyone who lived at Monan's Rill will need our support to pick up the pieces of their lives and begin to reimagine their futures, individually and collectively.Please join me in helping members of the Monan’s Rill Community with a new beginning.  Your gifts will help the people of Monan's Rill meet short-term needs for living expenses and replacing lost belongings, cleanup of the extensive fire debris, and repairs to community infrastructure such as the water system and the garden which likely will not be covered by insurance. Your donation will help the community stay connected and rebuild together a responsible, climate-resilient, eco-friendly, fire-adapted community of the future. This fundraiser is about so much more than 12 families losing houses. You can support Monan's Rill in their vision for maintaining a space where people care and support each other and model living on the land in ways that contribute to a healthier future for us all. We appreciate any financial gift that you can offer in order to help the members of Monan’s Rill to rebuild their lives. This dynamic intentional community, rich in vision and craftsmanship, has worked in consensus for half a century, through thick and thin. They have built homes, grown food, raised children and animals, gathered other people in life, marriage, and death, all the while celebrating and carefully tending to the beauty of the land. You can help Monan's Rill become an even stronger beacon of hope for community, interdependence, resilience, and regenerative rural living. Please give generously today!Monan’s Rill Association (MRA) is a collectively-owned intentional community on 414 acres in the Mayacamas Mountains within a 20-25 minute drive to Santa Rosa, Calistoga, and St. Helena. MRA is centered on the core values of Honoring Every Voice, Relationships and Caring for Each Other, Stewardship, and Stability.  For more information about Monan’s Rill and its members, visit http://www.monansrill.org/ or read the recent article from Made Local Magazine (https://madelocalmagazine.com/2020/06/a-rill-runs-through-it/).When the land was purchased, the creek that runs through it was already named Monan’s Rill, from a line in a poem written by Sir Walter Scott:“The stag at eve had drunk his fill, where danced the moon on Monan’s Rill.”“At our best, we listen deeply, argue honestly, build our capacities, and model a joyful, equitable way to live on this earth.”  --Amy Robinson, Monan's Rill MemberReflections from Friends of Monan's Rill:“Monan's Rill remains beloved in my and many many hearts, and that is for all time. It is a blessed legacy and place.”  --David Hoffman“Monan’s Rill is magical. I so hope you rebuild and rekindle the shining light of that place.”  --Beth Landau-Halpern“I’m deeply sorry for the loss of history and craftsmanship, and more so for the loss of home to you all and those that came before. May the entire community - including LandPaths - be there to help in any creative way at our collective and individual fingertips. For a community founded in love of place and land I’m deeply saddened that this destruction has happened for you and your good neighbors. Tell us how we may help you.”  --Craig Anderson“Such a tremendous loss for you all, and for all of us who know the Rill as a beating heart around which community turns.”  --Meg Hamill

The program is designed to create pathways for young Black Americans to get their start in politics. The Gayle family needs to raise an additional $80,000 to make the program permanent at Clemson, and is also considering expanding to other schools. Each year, two students will be selected as Tyrone Gayle Scholars. These students will receive a $3,500 stipend to pursue a summer internship in a political field. This could be on a campaign, on Capitol Hill, at an advocacy organization, or in other government sectors. In addition to the stipend, these students will be matched with a number of different mentors from Tyrone’s network. These mentors will guide the students through the often insular political world, help them make the most of their internships, and help them build their network. Tyrone adamantly believed that nothing in this country could change until the people in power look like the people they represent. And in Tyrone’s eyes, that begins in part by creating opportunities in our campaigns, our advocacy organizations, and in our Hill offices for Black Americans. Tyrone also knew this would not change until we knock down the barriers that prevent Black Americans from joining and advancing in political careers.  To learn more about the program and Tyrone’s legacy, click here .

Go where your heart leads you and let the chips fall where they may…   I saw this story this morning and my heart was touched beyond belief. In a world with so much fear and division, any sign of hope for a future of positive change should be cherished, nurtured and fought for. At 10 years old, Tybre Faw is a shining light in a dark time. Tyber asked family members to take him on a 7 hour drive. Not to an amusement park or a vacation spot like most 10 year olds, but rather to Selma, Alabama from Johnson City, Tennessee so that he could have a chance to meet civil rights icon, the late John Lewis. To meet him, shake his hand and to tell him how he gave him “courage” “raw courage”.   Tybre is an avid reader and has a deep love for Black History. Even at his age, Tybre identifies with many of the historical struggles black people have endured and continue to endure to this day. He wants to grow up and make a difference. He wants to be a congressman and follow in the footsteps of the late John Lewis. He is very active in the fight for positive change.   He marches for his future. He marches for the equal opportunity to succeed. He marches for the equal opportunity to be educated, and that’s why I’m writing this. Please join me in trying to help secure our future for positive souls like this. Help me in trying to secure his educational future. We can’t afford this light to burn out before it has a chance to shine.   He has no idea I am doing this, but his family does. He doesn’t even know me. He will see this at same time you will. Let’s help in getting him the quality education he deserves to make a difference. Lets not let his future educational path be determined by what one can afford.

Hi! I'm Roberto Tobias and I'm currently a rising senior at Frank McCourt High School in New York City. With the start of Senior year rapidly approaching, the same goes for the intimidating season of college applications.





Ever since elementary school, I've always seen my education as an important aspect of my life. I always strived to do my best, hell, even past the expectations that I thought was set for myself. From elementary school to middle school and especially high school, I always aspired to pursue my goals and dreams.With my drive and desire to succeed, I was able to achieve many amazing feats throughout my academic career. As of the end of my Junior year, I was able to finish the year with an overall GPA of 93, I received an opportunity to work as an assistant at Mt. Sinai Queens, I have helped organize many events under Student Government, and I actively volunteer at events for my school to support my hardworking teachers. Just as millions of people around the world have experienced the harsh realities of COVID-19, I had as well. Throughout the entirety of March of this year, my entire family, including myself, ended up catching COVID. My father, Roberto Tobias Sr., was the first to realize the severity of the virus. Originally, he was the one to warn my sister and I to be careful whenever we went outside. He took the virus seriously from the start, especially due to his ailments. He was 72 years old who was diabetic and was a former heavy smoker. The same went with my mother, Loida Tobias, as well. She was 61, diabetic, dealt with hypertension, and was as susceptible to the virus as my father.  Over the span of a few weeks, my father's health began deteriorating and my mother used her vacation days to take care of my father. She's a nurse and naturally, she wanted to help our father and ensure that he would hopefully recover from this. However, with that, she inevitably caught the virus as well. This eventually would lead to the virus spreading to the rest of my family and we would be in poor shape for weeks. Unfortunately, my parents took the brunt of the virus and they eventually were hospitalized due to their conditions worsening. Although the chances were slim, my sister and I had hope that they would recover and eventually be discharged, but they, unfortunately, ended up passing. My father would pass away due to complications on May 30th, and my mother would pass away on June 30th. My parents were amazing and lived exceptional lives. They grew up in their own impoverished homes back in the Philippines, but they always pursued higher education to be able to take care of their brothers, sisters, and their parents. Despite the conditions they were born and forced into, they managed to persevere and would receive their degrees at Far Eastern University in Manila. My mother received a degree to pursue a career in nursing, and my father would get a teacher's degree to study and teach physics. Eventually, my parents would meet and, as it goes, fell in love. My dad would then immigrate to the U.S. in 1990 to start a family with my mom and find new opportunities for themselves. My dad would eventually land a job as a bartender at the Windows of the World in the World Trade Center and my mom would also become a head nurse at Harlem Hospital Center. They would then have my sister in 1991 and have me in 2003. My realization of my dreams came from inspiration from my parents, learning my true passions, and the discovery of what I wanted to pursue in my life. When I enter college, I want to study premed and go on to medical school to pursue a career as a neurosurgeon. However, with the passing of my parents, the security of my future is unclear because I don't have a source of income to help fund my education. Hopefully, with this fundraiser, I'll be able to help fund my first year of college while I work towards funding my own career. Any amount would definitely be appreciated and I genuinely thank you for reading this.Roberto Tobias Jr






Note: There has been people who are wondering about the beneficiary for my fundraiser. Pureza Capriles is actually my aunt and guardian who will be handling my funds for me.

KZV Armenian School, a 40 year old Armenian elementary school in San Francisco, was vandalized the night of July 23rd 2020 by Turkish and Azeri nationalists.  Obscene and threatening political slogans, profanities and hate speech were graffiti'd on children's classrooms. Needless to say, the cowardly targeting of children on nationalistic grounds is both unacceptable and terrifying.We ask you to send a message of hope and strength to counteract evil and hatred. These funds will enable us to immediately address the vandalism as well as improve security on the campus.KZV Armenian School is the only Armenian School in Northern California. It has served generations of Armenian youth, teaching them their ethnic language and history alongside the standard educational framework. The school is a backbone of the Armenian community connecting Armenian-Americans across the greater Bay Area. We will not allow terrorists and thugs to erode that in any way. Thank you for your consideration of support. 

This GoFundMe is organized by the school board of KZV, with members based across San Francisco. Please see https://www.kzv.org/kzvboard for more information. The board assists the administration in managing and caring for the school, its teachers, students, and parent community. The funds will be disbursed directly to the school to be used for graffiti cleanup, repair of damage to walls, floors, doors and gates, re-painting, and enhancement of the current fencing, security gates, and automated parking lot gates.

According to ProjectDiane, only 0.2% of all venture capital funding was allocated toward startups founded by Black women in 2016. We are crowdfunding $65,000 of start-up costs to ensure our efforts to create a liberatory-based community space have a long lasting, and sustainable promising future. Our start-up cost breakdown:*Monthly rent: $1,800 x 12 months = $21, 600Utilities + misc repairs x 12 months: $1,200Renovation/build-out costs: $25,000External/internal signs + furnishings: $7, 200Operating expenses: $10,000Total: $65,000*Given our renovation costs, build-out timeline, COVID-19 restrictions, and our anticipated opening date of Jan 2021, monthly rental funds will be allocated to our first year open to the public for business. In the words of ancestor Toni Cade Bambara, “The dream is real, my friends.” We hope you’ll join us in building the reality we need for the future we deserve. Stay tuned to our instagram for updates on what we’ve got planned for 2020 and 2021 and additional ways you can support. Thank you in advance for your non-monetary expressions of support via affirmation, good energies, and shares.......About the organizer:My name is Asha Grant. I'm a Los Angeles native, freelance creative media consultant, bookworm, and director of The Free Black Women's Library - Los Angeles (a Black feminist traveling book swap). Ever since I was a tiny, safehouses for me have been libraries and independent bookstores. In indie bookstores, I had the room as a Black girl to be brave with my curiosities, affirmed by characters in places I knew and wanted to know, and comfortable knowing I was surrounded by folks who, too, loved the community built around a good story. Through my work in launching + sustaining @thefreeblackwomenslibrary_la, I’ve been able to create mini literary safehouses for us all throughout the city, lugging tubs of books in my car and cramming bags of craft supplies in my trunk to community centered businesses and museums who hosted us for little to nothing and loved on us more than I can express. It’s been a beautiful, humbling journey. It is far from over. Last fall, I began looking for spaces. It marked my first step in claiming the vision - a loving and inviting bookshop dedicated to prioritizing books, comics, and zines by and about Black women, girls, femmes, and non-binary folks. A resting ground. A brave space. A Black place. A quiet nook to visit and read and print after school. Somewhere for the babies to have storytime. A place to nerd out in and be cool in and feel loved. I been working on the vision - crunching the numbers, meeting with the realtor, planning with my contractor, designing mood boards, brainstorming programming, and praying. Nightly. Sometimes all throughout the day. It’s the dream I can’t shake and I’m rolling with it. It is sooo close. The Salt Eaters, is derived from Toni Cade Bambara’s book THE SALT EATERS that provided my first in depth, and, admittedly, destabilizing look into the murky waters of mental health for folks that looked like me and expanded my understanding of wholeness (“no trifling matter”), interdependency, astrology, Black feminism, and beyond. Her unwavering principles and ethics guide both my personal and professional endeavors, leading me here.

Over the past decade, the Ertel family home has been a place for members of the community to come together and connect. Through shabbat dinners, Wednesday night challah bakes, and other celebrations their home is seen more of a community center than a private residence.

The Academy of Movement and Music will be forced to close its doors permanently next year without your support.With in-person classes suspended from March through July of 2020 and strict social-distancing guidelines now in effect, enrollment has plummeted. Should the Academy close, dozens of teachers will lose their jobs, and an invaluable and historic asset for arts and dance education in our community will be lost.Health and safety mandates have prevented the Academy from returning to full in-person class capacity. Although we are doing our absolute best to supplement in-person class enrollment by offering remote instruction via Zoom, we have not been able to bring enrollments up to sustainable levels and fully recuperate from the financial loss caused by the pandemic.We are grateful that current tuition income is covering all of our teachers' salaries, but it isn’t enough to keep our doors open and the lights on. We are seeking your help to raise the funds which we desperately need to cover business overhead.In addition to this fundraiser, the Academy has applied for government-sponsored grants and loans and for a three-month deferment and refinance of the mortgage on the building. We are doing everything in our power to keep our teachers and staff employed and to be able to continue offering outstanding artseducation to the children of our community.The success of this fundraiser will allow the Academy to stay afloat through the remainder of the current program year. We pray that effective treatments and a vaccine against the Coronavirus will be developed in the not-too-distant future and that our way of life can return to normal.If you are an alumna/us who grew up at the Academy; if you have a child who attends the A.R.T.S. program or dance classes; if you are a patron of the arts or a community member who values the continuation of arts education in the Oak Park area; please consider helping our school survive COVID-19!

At the time, Mary was raising 3 young children (Ben, Rachel, and Joshua) and working part-time. Supported by her amazing husband, Jonathan Prier, and family, Mary endured extensive chemotherapy, radiation treatments and a mastectomy. This was all quite the shock, but Mary was resilient and came through the treatments with a clean bill of health.If you don’t personally know Mary, imagine one of the smartest, sweetest, nicest, and most amazing mothers and you will start to get an idea. If you already know Mary, she likely has made a memorable impact in your life. Mary grew up in Dayton, Ohio and attended St. Anthony Elementary (’98 Grad) and Chaminade-Julienne High School (’02 Grad). Mary obtained her bachelor’s degree from the University of Dayton (’06 Grad) and a master’s degree from the Ohio State University. She is active at her church (St. Matthew) in Gahanna, Ohio, and a wonderful person.After the chemotherapy and radiation, Mary’s likelihood of getting pregnant again was very low: and so it was a wonderful surprise to learn she was pregnant again in 2019. On Thursday, May 7th, 2020 Mary and Jonathon welcomed a miracle baby (Luke) to their family. Mom and baby were healthy and home from the hospital two days later on Saturday, May 9th. Everyone was happy and excited for this joyous life moment.All of this makes the next part of this story difficult to tell.On Tuesday, May 12th, Mary suffered a seizure at home and was temporarily unresponsive. Mary was rushed to the hospital and underwent an extensive work up including CT scans and MRIs. The tests revealed multiple lesions in her brain; and additional lesions in her liver and lung.  A biopsy from her liver revealed she has Stage 4 recurrent metastatic breast cancer.  She will undergo radiation and chemotherapy in the upcoming weeks and months.  Many family and friends are reaching out to help in any way possible; and Jon and Mary are very thankful for this support. A separate account has been set-up for the benefit of Mary’s 4 young children (Ages 8, 6, 4, and 1 week) and intended to help offset costs related to childcare and future education. Any contribution amount is truly appreciated. We hope this campaign will be a small token to show Mary and Jon they are not alone in this fight. Thank you for your thoughts and prayers. God Bless.

Our beloved little school, where our children are cared for as if they are the teachers' own, needs our help. The parents of current Escuelita students have created this #vivaescuelita fundraising campaign to provide financial support for the school to use as instability continues. Without our help, the school will likely have to close permanently. Originally founded in 2000 to provide childcare for employees of Las Manitas, the legendary Congress Avenue cafe, Escuelita is a shining example of what makes Austin a unique and special place. Many of the teachers have been at Escuelita for decades, and some of them are even related to each other -- making this Beloved Little School feel even more like a family.On average, Escuelita has 190 students in attendance daily. Since the return to school in June, this number decreased to around 80. The school was forced to lay off half its staff and has been staying afloat through PPP loans and tuition prepayments. The goal of this fundraising campaign is to raise $75,000 (recently updated from $50,000) to keep the school running through the uncertainty of the next year. These funds may be used to help cover part of an outstanding loan that the school took out to finance a previous move, to pay rent and bills, teacher salaries, etc. The Escuelita staff and a team of parents are exploring grant funding opportunities as well.We hope you will join us in helping Escuelita stay afloat during this difficult time so that we can ensure it continues to nurture and inspire Austin children for years to come. Please donate and share this campaign with your friends and family.  #VivaEscuelita #SmallBusinessRelief

Due to prolonged CPR, Steve sustained an anoxic brain injury.  While the medical teams were able to restart and repair his heart, Steve never regained consciousness. Steve, a registered organ donor was able to donate both of his kidneys, enabling two people to benefit from his gift of life.Many of you have asked “how can I help?”  Julie and Steve have many friends and family who have been helping them through this very difficult time.  In the coming days, weeks, months and years, Julie and Chase will be navigating through a challenging time as they adapt to living without their best friend, husband and father.  Julie will be working hard to balance personal, professional, and family commitments as a single parent.  The physical, emotional and financial stress will be ever-present.  Therefore, we are establishing the Steven Holmes Memorial Education Fund to support Chase’s (age 9) future education.  We would ask you to consider a donation in any amount. Chase is an active 4th grader who attends Montessori school. He enjoys video games, riding his bike & scooter and TaeKwonDo (he will be testing for his Black Belt in the Spring of 2021).  He loves exploring the outdoors much like his dad did. In addition to Julie and Chase, Steve is survived by his daughter, Hannah (25) as well as his parents (Tom & Janet Holmes) and siblings (Cynthia & Phillip). Steve is a veteran of the Marine’s and was an avid photographer & musician who loved CrossFit, modern architecture, industrial design and exploring the outdoors. To those who knew him (of which they are many, since he never met a stranger) he was a relentlessly positive person who loved to lift people up & cheer them on.  Julie is a Financial Operations Director at Grant Thornton providing guidance and support to hundreds of employees every month. Many of us have worked with Julie for years at Grant Thornton and IBM.  Julie is a consultant at heart and takes great pride in helping our employees support their clients. She has a passion for helping others and it is not unusual to receive emails from Julie late in the evening hours when she is working on a critical task. Her passion, positive attitude and desire to help others makes her an outstanding Operations Director and someone that we are all blessed to have on our team.

He turned 23 on May 31st, the day before his mother’s untimely death, and Philip turned 15 on June 2nd, the day after.Erica was a loving, sweet and kind person that would never hurt anyone. She lived life in a special way, always welcoming people of all walks of life, and treating her friendships unconditionally. Erica was a gentle and fragile soul who wanted to take care of everyone.However, her life took a tragic turn roughly 3 years ago when her husband, Lyndon, fell down a flight of stairs and suffered severe brain trauma. He is unable to spell his own name and at times he cannot even formulate a sentence. Unfortunately, he will never again be the man they once knew as their father.That fall left the kids without the father they knew and loved and they had to adjust quickly to a new way of life, with a Dad that was unable to play sports, bike ride, or ever walk again. On many days, he cannot even recognize them as his sons.His own memory of life as he knew it has been shattered.As parents, Lyndon and Erica made sure that Danny and Philip received the best education possible and taught them to be productive members of society and good human beings. Philip is currently enrolled in a fantastic school and his parents were unable to foresee a tragedy of this magnitude.With these events unfolding and all of the emotional stress even Love couldn’t sustain the bumps and turns. As Lyndon, the provider for the family, was and still is unable to function due to his medical condition, the bills started to mount, income was scarce and the mortgages were due.This financial hardship and emotional trauma, took its toll on the children and especially, on Erica.Erica gave her all to care and provide for a man that was no longer the robust man she married: active, social and hardworking. He was bedridden and unable to perform the simplest of tasks, including feeding himself or going to the bathroom. Erica tried to be as strong as possible for herself and her children.Lyndon suffered seizures and was placed into a facility where he was able to receive the skilled help he needed.The last 3 years have been quite a battle; a battle on all levels, financial, emotional and spiritual. The financial burden has become an unsustainable spiral and the financial obligations continue to grow. Our nephews now find themselves without parents to guide and support them and in the worst possible scenario.They are good boys, good souls and amazing future servants to society.With the loss of both parents and now their home about to be foreclosed on, they are left with monumental financial hardships and just the clothes on their backs. This has placed them in a delicate emotional, and financial state.Amongst some of their expenses are education, clothing, medical, transportation, daily expenses, food and no parental contributions to support them financially on this path.We, as their aunts and uncles will do all that we possibly can to support them the best we can.We understand that the current state of world affairs has many people struggling financially.However, if you are able to contribute, in any way, so that these boys can create a new beginning, a new life, and get the help they need to remain psychologically balanced, as well as meet their financial obligations it would be forever appreciated.No contribution is too small. Every bit counts.The old adage “it takes a village” is what it will take to ensure that our nephews Danny and Philip get the support they need to re- establish their lives and live a healthy, vibrant and emotionally stable existence.On behalf of the Beaman and Giocoli family we thank you, and we are all in this together!

Instead, he’s in critical condition at the ICU in Holtz Children’s Hospital after suffering complications while undergoing a 15+ hour-long heart and liver transplant surgery on July 24th. He has spent the last month sedated and paralyzed and his recovery has been very slow and painful. The goal of this campaign is to raise funds to help the Parodi family cover medical expenses and to establish a college fund for Anthony's education because he WILL recover, he WILL go back to school and he WILL go to college in a couple years. Anthony is no stranger to hospitals. He was born with a serious heart condition and he has endured countless surgeries since his birth. However, the last year has been exceptionally difficult for him and his family as his health deteriorated and his liver stopped functioning. Doctors placed him on the national wait list for both a heart and liver transplant, and for the past year, he has been patiently waiting for a donor to save his life. He has been unable to leave the hospital during the last six months because of his delicate condition. As a result of the pandemic, only one parent can accompany him in the hospital at a time and he has not been able to receive any visitors.An incredibly intelligent and kind young man who has always been an A student, Anthony is a big fan of comic books, Legos and Deadpool. Ryan Reynolds himself publicly invited him to be a part of the next Deadpool movie. Anthony has felt the love of his Belen brothers and his extended family during this difficult time. Anthony and his family are incredibly grateful for the love and support the Belen Jesuit community has given them during these past months along with so many others. During the 8/13 live broadcast of Univision’s Premios Juventud, one of the music awards shows his father production manages, the entire production crew gave Anthony a standing ovation and wished him a speedy recovery live, on-air. Immediately after his transplant surgery, an emergency blood drive organized for him at his parish broke records and was the biggest blood drive organized for any one recipient in Miami’s history. It goes without saying that Anthony is loved by many in the Miami community. Many who have been touched by him and/or by his family, who wish they could do more to help during this extremely difficult time.Needless to say, the Parodi family’s finances have been stretched very thin as a result of Anthony’s extended hospital stay and the serious complications that arose during the transplant surgery. The situation has been aggravated by the pandemic as Anthony’s father, Tony, works as a live event, concert & television producer, one of the industries most impacted by COVID. Anthony’s parents are mindful about everyone else’s own struggles during these unprecedented times and they are too selfless to ever ask for help; therefore, this campaign has been organized on their behalf. We have been overwhelmed by requests from friends, extended family and colleagues who want to help the Parodi Family in any way that they can… to give back in return for the countless ways in which Tony and Sonia have positively impacted their own lives. What better way to do so than with a donation to help secure Anthony’s future once he recovers?Anthony will recover. He will live a healthy, normal life. He will graduate Belen and he will go to college in a couple years. How amazing would it be for the Parodi family to have Anthony’s medical expenses covered, but also to be able to plan for college once he recovers, without having to worry about money? Let’s join together to help Tony, Sonia and Noella manifest Anthony’s recovery, celebrate his high school graduation and send him off to college healthy, happy and without any financial concerns.

Massive Ballot By Mail Vote Harvesting Scheme in Texas Must Be Stopped

By Steven F. Hotze, M.D.The socialist Democrat leadership in Harris County has developed a massive ballot by mail vote harvesting scheme to steal the general election. Ballot harvesting is a second-degree felony in Texas.  We are working with a group of private investigators who have uncovered this massive election fraud scheme. County Commissioner Rodney Ellis is the Democrat leader of this criminal operation. He has two captains, Gerald Womack and Dallas Jones, who pay hundreds of “soldiers” to illegally harvest ballots by mail from nursing homes, the homeless, the poor, students and even from those who have died. Our private investigators have been told by informants that the Democrats boast that they can get 700,000 illegal ballots by mail in Harris County alone.You can help us expose and stop this massive election fraud scheme by donating here at the Liberty Center for God & Country’s GoFundMe account.Liberty Center for God & Country is a 501(c)3 organization committed to standing up for our God-given, unalienable rights and liberties. It employs legal action to ensure that these rights and liberties are protected.  Donations are tax deductible.The socialist Democrats turned Harris County blue in the 2016 elections. In 2012, Obama and Romney were dead even in votes in Harris County, which has over 2.2 registered voters. In 2016, Trump lost to Hillary Clinton in Harris County by 140,000 votes, but carried Texas by 8 percentage points. In 2018, Cruz lost Harris County to Beto O’Rourke by 200,000 votes, despite the fact that the polls showed that Cruz was ahead by 9 percentage points in Harris County. We now understand how this happened. The Democrats have been employing their massive ballot by mail vote harvesting scheme to steal elections. Prior to 2016, Harris County was the largest Republican County in the country, and yet Trump lost to Clinton here. This is amazing when you consider that Trump carried the Democrat controlled states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin that same year.The Texas Biden campaign has hired Dallas Jones, the major Harris County vote harvester, to run Biden’s campaign in Texas.It is obvious that they hired Jones, so that the same illegal ballot by mail vote harvesting program could be used in other Texas’ metropolitan areas and other counties controlled by the Democrats. This would include Dallas, Tarrant, Bexar, Travis, and counties in the Valley. Unless this massive election fraud scheme is exposed and stopped, Texas will be turned blue and Trump will be defeated.As Harris County goes, so goes Texas. As Texas goes, so goes the country. Texas has 35 electoral votes.  If those votes are shifted from the Trump column to the Biden column, that is a swing of 70 electoral votes. It only takes 270 electoral votes to win the presidential election. You can help us expose and stop this massive election fraud scheme by donating here at the Liberty Center for God & Country’s GoFundMe account. Please consider giving $25, $50, $100, $500 or more to help us stop this voter fraud scheme.

He was operated on almost immediately. He underwent extensive chemotherapy and post-operative treatment. Between the consistent chemo sessions and fear of seizures (a common after effect), he was unable to work since. He was on Long term disability. Fortunately, Priti (his wife) had started working as a teacher just before this tragedy hit. This came in handy to cover a majority of the medical costs through her insurance. Sanjay bravely fought through these four years and was still the same person for the first 3 years of this period. However, the last year saw the cancer resurface in a more aggressive form and it was downhill from there. He lost consciousness in the last 10 days of his life after a final seizure that took the fight away from him. Sanjay was a gentle and kind soul who was liked by one and all. He was always helpful to those he came in contact with. He was a devoted husband and father. As a professional, he was a natural leader and personable to all the people who reported to him. He was frequently lauded for being a great boss. Unfortunately, Sanjay ended up without a life insurance from his company due to a technicality. The medical expenses of the last 4 years took its toll on the financial situation of the family.He leaves behind his wife and two college going kids.  This is an effort by the friends of Sanjay to cover a portion of the education expenses for the family.

Without proper technology such as internet access or devices (laptops, tablets, etc), it’s nearly impossible for all students to receive a fair chance at education. I want to become a resource for these students. I'm raising money in conjunction with Think About It! Consulting Services Inc., where 100% of donations will go towards the purchase of Chromebooks, with help from my guys at Cxmmunity. These devices will go directly to Early County High School students in need and will be theirs to keep! Any donation no matter how small will help make an impact.A recent study reported that 43% of students in Early County do not have access to either high speed internet or an at-home learning device. Since the decision was made for Early County schools to continue some form of remote learning at the start of the school year, these students need our help now more than ever. We all know the importance and impact of technology and access to information. My hope is that we can start to close the digital divide by providing these students with a device they can keep with them from high school to hopefully college and beyond.

He was having up to 100 per day and was put in a medically induced coma until the doctors at Riley could figure out what to do. Finally, after 3 weeks, he had a right frontal lobectomy – removing the right frontal quadrant of his brain. The doctors were not sure the surgery would be successful, and it was the first surgery of its kind. The surgery was successful - he has not had any seizures since surgery - but it did leave him with many challenges. He is a bright young man, but his shine is hard to see due to the lack of executive functioning skills. He excels in math and science and loves to play chess, card games (pretty much wins every time!), enjoys nature (has been a beekeeper), and of course video games! Most people do not have to think about their executive functions….they are just a part of everyday life. Getting up in the morning, having breakfast, and getting ready for the day are just routine. For Dalton, these daily routines require many steps, guidance, and skills he does not have.Dalton has graduated from Fortune Academy, a school for children with learning differences, with a Core-40 diploma. We have been searching for a college program that can meet his needs. He is now 20 years old. We have looked into colleges that provide high levels of academic support but they do not provide the independent living and life skills which Dalton needs in order to be successful in college. We have also looked at assisted living/group home programs, but they tend to provide aid with daily living but do not provide education and/or career assistance. So, we are at a standstill. We finally found the College Internship Program in Bloomington, Indiana.  CIP helps young adults with Autism, ADHD and other learning differences who are transitioning from high school into adulthood.  CIP provides an individualized college academic path and/or career support and advisement, social skills development, and executive functioning for life skills. Students live in apartments and have daily life skill coaches to work on the daily executive function tasks like grocery shopping, cooking, personal organization, planning, cleaning, and laundry.   As they are learning life and social skills, they are also meeting with onsite advisors and counselors to work on future educational or career goals.  Depending on the goal, students can enroll in courses with support at Ivy Tech or IU.   Additionally, CIP partners with many local businesses to find an area in the students’ interest and ultimately helps them work toward their personal goals.Our next hurdle is to raise enough money to allow Dalton the opportunity to attend CIP.We have a donor that will match up to $40,000  towards the $90,000/year needed to put Dalton through the CIP program.  If you would like to support Dalton, pledges of any amount will help get him one step closer to CIP.Thanks so much for your support.

Our founder, King Randall, began this organization at 19 years old. He started this organization to teach young boys in the community how to be men. Albany, Georgia was ranked very high in crime and murder has been prevalent for the past decade.  The literacy rates for boys is low and there are no major activities for boys to learn and participate in, to keep them out of trouble.  King Randall has done a number of workshops ranging from automotive repair(oil change, brake repair, alternator replacement, water pump replacement etc.) to general contractor work(toilet replacement, light fixtures, sheetrock, interior/exterior painting, woodwork etc.). The boys get a chance to learn the skilled trades and also make legal money. 

To tackle the low literacy rates in the city, The X for Boys also has a weekly book club that's hosted every Monday for boys to attend after-school. It helps them with reading comprehension and vocabulary building. The boys also get to receive sex education and also have a place to release any stress or issues in a non-judgmental environment. The X for Boys has hosted 2 successful summer camps that King Randall did both years out of his home. Visit thexforboys.org to see videos! 

The X for Boys is now interested in purchasing a building to start a boarding school for boys in Albany, Georgia. This is a much needed man-making institution. If there is no one to CONSISTENTLY help our young men, the community and the society will remain the same if our men never are taught to stand up for their families.  We need your help to get this building in hope that The X for Boys expands across the country but first starting in Albany, Georgia!"

Born to Peter and Anna Heaney in 1969, Patrick , together with his six siblings were raised on 16th Street in a house that was filled with love, a deep, strong sense of community and a proud Irish Heritage.  He was thrilled to raise his four children with his wife, Joan, in the very same house instilling in them those same family values.   If you saw Patrick around the neighborhood, he was usually coming or going to the park, where he coached all 4 of his children in the Holy Name Fathers Guild Sports Program. He always wore a smile, wanted to help others, and was generous to all those around him. However, his children were the light of his life, and this fund will be used strictly for the future education of Patrick (19), Maureen (17), Caroline (15), and Peter (12). Patrick attended Holy Name School and was as a life-long active parishioner of Holy Name of Jesus Parish. He graduated from Bishop Ford High School. Patrick was proud of his Irish heritage as he followed his Father’s footsteps as a member of Clann Eireann Pipe Band and the Brooklyn Irish American Parade Committee. He proudly marched with his bagpipes and traditional Irish gear. Patrick volunteered and was committed to the annual Christmas Tree Lighting in our Lady's Field on 16th Street. Patrick was a dedicated civil servant working for the New York City Housing Authority and Housing Preservation and Development. Patrick was also a talented woodworker and spent lots of time in the great outdoors while fishing, hunting and swimming with the family. Most of all, Patrick was truly a kind and gentle soul who set a fine example for all to follow. His sudden loss will be grieved by all who had the honor of knowing him. His love of God, Family and Country will live on through his wonderful children. Please help honor his memory and his family by contributing whatever you can for the future of their education.  Thank you.

Dearest Maine Teen Camp Community, As you may be aware, MTC had to cancel the 2020 season. This would have been the 35th summer as Maine Teen Camp. The decision to cancel the season was a devastating one, both emotionally and financially. First and foremost – everyone really (really, really) needed camp this summer. After what was a troubling spring, nothing would have made anyone happier than to gather the campcommunity in that little corner of Maine. All the individual plans that campers and staff had been making since September 2019; all the hard work done by the MTC staff to prepare and plan; all the amazing moments that should have happened, but it wasn’t to be. Along with about 90% of camps in New England, MTC sadly also had to call off the season. The decision to cancel has also taken a massive emotional toll on the immediate camp family, from Matt and Monique to Nicky, and Mark.  Camp isn’t just a job - this place and the people who arethere in the summer are their emotional center of the universe. When they talk about the camp family, they genuinely mean it. It has also been a ruinous decision financially. And while they knew it would be, they weren't willing to risk a single camper or staff members’ safety. They made a decision based on the risks as they could assess them, regardless of the financial impact it would impose. The fiscal implications are obvious. An entire year with zero revenue. Initially they were hopeful that between an insurance policy to cover cancellation of the season, and indications of adequate government support, they would be able to scrape through the year. There is limited support and government support is shaping up to be too little, too late. Which is why camp needs your help. We know MTC had a significant and transformational  impact on your life, your child’s life or the life of someone important to you. We want camp to be in a position to continue to do so for many years to come. But we need help to get from here to there. Without the help of our camp community, the prospects of summer 2021 and beyond are bleak. With the financial help of our community, we know that camp can continue to provide meaningful, life affirming summers to amazing campers from all walks of life, with a diversity of interests, and with a sense of belonging that endures through the decades.  We hate to ask you for help during this financially challenging time for so many. Unfortunately, without your help, we cannot ensure the survival of MTC to the 2021 season. If it is in your capacity to help us by donating large or small, we would be forever grateful. If you'd prefer, you can send checks directly to  Maine Teen Camp, 481 Brownfield Road, Porter ME 04068Thank you for your direct support of many more beautiful days in the state of Maine.Washtae, The MTC Alumni Communications Committee

UPDATE

Tim's family would like to thank everyone for their generous contribution.Timothy MJ Walton Remembrance Fund has been set up at the Downing College in the University of Cambridge.The College will use this gift for the purposes of establishing the “Timothy MJ Walton Remembrance Fund” which will be endowed and the annual income used for student support (including hardship, books, travel grants, course materials, vacation study and other financial needs relating to academic study) at Downing College (both undergraduate and postgraduate). Timothy Mark Joseph Walton passed away on Friday, July 31sth 2020 in Manhattan at the age of 47, 3 weeks after a fatal cycling accident. Through the decades that Tim had chosen to call NYC his home, Tim had always maintained strong connections with his alma mater; whether through his many long standing friendships with his University friends, attending NYC based gatherings sponsored by other alumni, taking his US friends to visit Downing and Cambridge whenever an opportunity arose, to penning articles in their alumni publications.  He had always talked about his days at Downing with so much joy and affection. Unlike most highly vaunted Universities in the US, many of the individual colleges such as Downing at Cambridge do not benefit from a large endowment. In commemoration of Tim, we would like to set up a small scholarship fund at Downing, the place where Tim had achieved academic and sporting excellence and made lifelong friendships.

Before the Syrian revolution began, I was a hardworking student. I used to be top of my class but I was obliged to drop out of the School of Dentistry at Aleppo University in 2012 for fear of arrest by the Syrian Government due its violent response to the peaceful protests on campus.During the war, I dedicated myself to peaceful activism against the brutal dictatorship of Bashar Al Assad, as I watched friends and family members and innocent civilians being ruthlessly killed. I taught myself English in order to better communicate with Western journalists and get our story out there. Facing a litany of death threats and constant bombardment, I was eventually forced to cross the border and settle in Turkey, where I began working as a freelance journalist. I've written for The Guardian and The Telegraph newspapers and contribute to the New Yorker and the New York Times. Recently, I was accepted at Columbia University in New York where I hope to study political science. Fortunately, I was awarded a partial scholarship from Columbia to cover half of the tuition but it is still not enough and that is why I am hoping you will make a donation to help pay for my first year of tuition. This is the opportunity of a lifetime. The education I will get at Columbia will give me the tools I need to serve my people and help my country when the time comes for it to rebuild.  For many people, war leaves them angry and bitter and full of hate.

Our doors have been closed for over three months to ensure the health, safety, and well-being of patrons, staff and the community. Even in the best of times it can be difficult to survive as a small business and we now face an uncertain future. Even once we reopen, it will likely be under greatly restricted conditions limiting our business activities.  As you may be aware, The Stonewall Inn is the first national gay historic landmark and the birthplace of the modern day LGBTQ rights movement.  We celebrate and pay homage to those individuals who first stood up for gay rights and sparked the Stonewall Riots. Those brave souls who first stood up for their rights and the rights of others, triggered a global movement that continues to be celebrated world-wide via gay pride celebrations and parades.We resurrected the Stonewall Inn once after it had been shuttered- and we stand ready to do it again- with your help. We worked diligently to resurrect it as a safe space for the community and  to keep the Stonewall Inn at the epicenter of the fight for the LGBTQ+ rights movement. It has been a community tavern, but also a vehicle to continue the fight that started there in 1969. Stonewall is the place the community gathers for celebrations, comes to grieve in times of tragedy, and rally to continue the fight for full global equality.Today, we are asking you to help Save Stonewall!  The Stonewall Inn faces an uncertain future and we are in need of community support. The road to recovery from the COVID 19 pandemic will be long and we need to continue to safeguard this vital piece of living history for the LGBTQ community and the global human rights movement and we now must ask for your help to save one of the LGBTQ+ communities most iconic institutions and to keep that history alive.

Prior to Covid we were a thriving business and had no debt. Then Covid hit and now at the end of our season, we are in debt and that debt will continue to rise quickly until Covid has passed and business returns to normal. We will celebrate our 50 year anniversary August 8, 2021 and are determined to make it to celebrate our 50th year anniversary. It is time to ask for help.WHAT HAPPENED?During the first half of our 6 month 2020 season, by state mandate we were not allowed to open in any capacity. We were disappointed that any of our safety plans, even private family tours, were not considered because we were classified as an amusement park. When we were allowed to open for the last half of our season, we were only allowed a capacity of 250 people including employees. Our park’s capacity is several thousand guests, so 250, including employees, does not begin to pay our bills. We have been very responsible, with temperature checks, sanitizing rides between each rider, extreme sanitizing, even outside, closing areas of the park where proper social distancing or sanitizing cannot be maintained, online reservations to control and document capacity and much more. We have worked hard to cut our operating expenses in less than half, but even so, that small capacity leads us further and further into debt. We are trying to be creative and exhaust all possible sources of income. We have put more items on our online store and started to auction off our father’s paintings, prints and memorabilia. This is why we have started our GoFundMe...to keep Enchanted Forest open to be enjoyed long after Covid is gone. THE ENCHANTED FOREST STORYIn the 60's, Roger, father of four young children, realized there was very little for a family to see and do together in Oregon. He formulated the idea for a theme park where he could use his creative talents and though he had very little time or money to make his dream a reality, he persisted anyway. He purchased the original 20 acres of land off Interstate 5 for four thousand dollars, in monthly payments of fifty dollars and began construction in 1964. He worked full-time at the Oregon State Highway Department. However, to finance his dream, he repaired watches and took extra commercial art jobs in his spare time, buying one sack of cement at a time. He worked on building the park after work and on weekends. The Tofte's own backyard became filled with storybook figures and small buildings as Roger also used every spare second at home to work on his dream.Everyone but Roger thought it was foolish to think that this idea could work. Roger's friends and co-workers used to tease him about his work on ""Idiot Hill."" That also seemed to be the bank's idea. Close to opening, Roger and Mavis needed $2,000 to put on the last touches to the park in order to be able to open, but had run out of every last dime. Their own bank would not loan them the money, because, of course, the Tofte family didn't have any cash. Only one bank took the chance on them and loaned them the money.Roger originally thought it would take only two years to build the Storybook Trail, which was the first section that he needed to complete before the park could open. Finally, after seven years, at 2:00 on Sunday, August 8, 1971, Roger and his wife Mavis hung up a piece of butcher paper saying ""OPEN"" on the fence and the first visitors entered the park. Admission was one dollar for adults and fifty cents for children and the starting wage was $1.65 per hour. There were 75 people the first day and 1,000 people the next Sunday. Roger's dream was finally a reality with Roger as the creative force and Mavis as the business head.Roger’s wife Mavis was the business head of Enchanted Forest until diagnosed with cancer and handed off the day to day operations of running the business to daughters Susan and Mary when they were young adults. Through the years, Roger and his family have been adding to his dream with new additions to the park. The Tofteville western town was built the second year, and the Haunted House opened in 1974. The Comedy Theatre was built for daughter Susan, who writes and directs the outrageous musical comedies based on fairy-tales and composes all park music. Money was continually put back into the business creating more to see and do. Over the years many more attractions were added, the Ice Mountain Bobsled Roller Coaster, The English Village, the Fantasy Fountains water-light show, the Big-Timber Log Flume ride, kiddie rides, and the interactive target shooting ride, The Challenge of Mondor. Now, Roger Tofte, though still the ringleader of Enchanted Forest, has successfully incorporated 2 of his children into the business, Susan and Mary, 2 of his grandchildren, Derek and Tim, Roger’s brother-in-law Dale and Tim’s wife, Ashley. According to Susan, this arrangement has worked out quite well, ""We're very lucky. We get along because we're each in charge of different projects and our areas don't overlap much. We work very well together.""THE FUTUREWith three generations of the Tofte family working at Enchanted Forest, the tradition and creativity will be carried on for many years to come with your help. Roger can still be seen almost daily out working in the park. If you see a man in his 90s riding around on a moped or repairing cement, it is probably Roger! As Roger says, "" We believe in attention to artistic detail. We want to offer our visitors something unique, with a lot of variety. We strive to be the hidden gem that people discover as their own special place."" Our goal right now is to save the business and survive through Covid so we are here for future generations to enjoy. We have cut our operating budget to less than half of what it would be during a normal year, but even so, with a capacity of only 250 mandated by our our state, this does not begin to cover costs to keep us in business. We will keep working hard and use all of our creativity, but we have decided this is the time to ask for help. To see the video interview with family member and park Co-manager Susan Vaslev with Aaron Mesh from Willamette Week click HERE https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbi6RbVxmlM&feature=emb_logo CONTRIBUTIONS OR GIFTS TO ENCHANTED FOREST, INC.

The name, they said, described the final metamorphic stage of a bookworm. In its early years, the store established itself as a neighborhood living room of sorts. Readers, non-readers, paying customers or passersby, Hicklebee’s welcomed all.Eventually, two partners would leave, another would join in, and for the last 30 years, we would remain: a sister team who set out to make the name Hicklebee’s synonymous with quality, community and a commitment to literacy for all.Over 41 years Hicklebee’s has continued to operate through recessions, the Loma Prieta earthquake, the advent of Big Box stores and the aggressive business practices of a certain online retailer (ahem). Still, we persisted.       In March when schools closed and non-essential businesses were shuttered, we made the case that books are essential and partnered with the Santa Clara County Office of Education to create the Keep Kids Reading Book Drive- a campaign to put books into the hands of students during the Covid-19 crisis. To date, the program has delivered bags of books to nearly 400 families in need. Which brings us to this campaign.Hicklebee's has stayed open in a limited capacity during this pandemic, and while we have been working hard taking orders, shipping books and offering curbside delivery, the loss of foot traffic, community events and school business has been financially devastating. The money raised from this campaign will cover those losses as well as operating costs, including payroll, through August. It will also give us time to prepare for the return of school, for our doors to open, and to welcome our community back home.We believe that Hicklebee’s is as essential to its community as the gift of reading it offers you.We are grateful to our community and look forward to recommending your favorite books for years to come. Be well, and stay safe.Monica Holmes and Valerie LewisA few highlights from our history in Willow Glen and in the bookselling community over the past 41+ years:   - As new members of the Willow Glen Merchants Association, we joined the movement to plant trees along Lincoln  Avenue, laying the groundwork for a revitalized Willow Glen and planting the seeds- literally- for the thriving Avenue that exists there today.    - We were key organizers of the first Willow Glen farmers market.    - We have hosted major public events throughout the years, that feature local and international authors and dignitaries for our entire community.        - Hicklebee’s has worked with publishers, authors and national media to encourage literacy as well as diversity in children’s books.    - We have appeared on television, radio, in periodicals and published books to promote literacy.   - Hicklebee’s has received coveted local and national awards including The Small   Business of the Year Award 2009 presented by Senator Joseph Simitian and The Pannell Award from the Women’s National Book Association in 2019 and 2004. The Pannell jury wrote:   “The winner in the Children’s Specialty Bookstore category, Hicklebee’s Bookstore in San Jose, Calif., is celebrating its 40th anniversary this month. It is the gold standard for children’s bookselling and an extraordinary place that outdoes itself every year."""

But when conditions are harsh and life is tenuous, it takes a team sworn to reciprocity to keep life going forward.”As Bruce Springsteen says in Johnny 99: “Now judge I got debts no honest man could pay”.We hope to be able to pay our debts, and to keep providing great books and great conversations to our communities for many years to come.  We cherish, and desperately need, your support at this time.Thanks for all of your support these many years.  May there be many more!With Gratitude & Respect,Alison Reid and John EvansDIESEL, A Bookstore

Ottobar began in a small location on Davis St in downtown Baltimore and has grown into the arts and music powerhouse venue known not just to our small gritty East Coast town, but the world. It’s as much a rock club as it is a museum for stickers and flyers from bands that have graced its stage over the many years. For those not in Baltimore, the Ottobar has been a cultural incubator for not just music, but performances of all varieties- It has been a nexus for so many of the creative folx that help to make Baltimore the wonderfully odd and fantastic city that it is. Some may remember, just last summer Tecla purchased the Ottobar in hopes of continuing the legacy of awesomeness that the venue provided to the community over the years. Her vision was to try and preserve Ottobar as it had been while forging ahead with new ideas and plans. Little did we know just what was in store for the music industry as a whole….There are so many venues that are having the same difficulties, and with no foreseeable help on the horizon the outlook is not great for any venue.You may consider donating to this campaign so that we can help her sustain Ottobar, until it is safe to experience live music again- no one wants to lose this cultural icon! Ottobar is an integral part of Baltimore's cultural fabric. The venue is under very real threat- the Covid-19 crisis has the club limping along at approximately 5% of normal. There hasn’t been any sign of it changing any time soon. Ottobar is a place that its community has depended on for many years to provide a vital space for the arts. It has presented THOUSANDS of concerts, poetry readings, book releases, film screenings, flea markets, art opening, spelling bees, and pet weddings to name only a few. The venue has also hosted MANY fundraisers, for social justice organizations, reproductive rights charities, environmental organizations, education in health initiatives and more. Alternative voices, minorities, women, LGBTQ+, everyone is included at Ottobar. We’re hoping this GoFundMe campaign will carry the venues' operations through this worst of times. Funds will be used for employee payroll, rents, basic operations, and supplies needed to protect all staff and guests to ensure their safety.

I have decided to set up a GoFundMe campaign for the 40 Acres & a Mule Project in order to collect money to buy agricultural land. This land purchased will be at least 40 acres and Black owned.  The proceeds of this campaign will:·       purchase of land to guarantee farm to table resources for the food industry; ·       serve to provide an outlet for Black foodways; and, ·       establish a safe haven to secure the legacy of Black foodways.   Historical context The term “40 acres and a mule” was derived from Union General William T. Sherman’s Special Field Order No 15 , issued on Jan. 16, 1865. The reparations movement, which continues to the current day, cites “40 acres and a mule” as the U.S. government's promise to make restitution to African Americans for enslavement. The significance of this promise to Black people was to present a conduit not only to be free, but also to own land and be integrated as a part of the fabric of the United States to achieve a more equal footing.  Freedom, land ownership, and the means to prosper were seen as a significant pathway to empowerment by enabling African Americans to be a part of the economy, create businesses, and community.  Why now?During these troubled times, there is an immediate need to protect and ground ourselves in land that we can call our own. There exists a need to create a legacy for our future generations.  The creation and sustainment of a legacy is one of the most important opportunities I see in the ""40 Acres & a Mule Project"".  It is a great chance to be able to control our narrative and provide educational opportunities to understand our story in food and farming techniques within the hospitality and food industry. My vision is to have a sanctuary to hold the history, food, and stories of Black culture in food and farming.   This land will be used to teach other how to farm, archive Black food ways and the importance of Black farms.  The 40 acres of land will tell the story of how Blacks grew food through our ancestral ways into today. Where will the campaign proceeds go?Any contributions made to the ""40 Acres & a Mule Project"" beyond the needed funds to purchase the land, taxes, and tools for the farm will be made available to Black organizations that concentrate on preserving Black foodways and support Black farmers in purchasing their own land, buy the land they lease, and/or provide assistance to Black farmers for their mortgage payments.Follow my Instagram  dedicated to this project"

Salt Lake City, UT	124368	250000	2.3K	103 days 00:37:31.755629000	6.5K	2.2K	2.3K	"Save Ken Sanders Rare Books!Welcome to the GoFundMe site in support of Ken Sanders Rare Books. This counter culture institution opened its doors in Salt Lake City 24 years ago. Beginning with no money, few books, and a teenaged daughter, KSRB has grown into an overflowing powerhouse of an antiquarian bookstore known throughout the Intermountain West, and the world. It’s as much a book shop as it is a museum. It’s a place where Ken’s generosity allows the muse to dwell. For those not in Utah, many of you may have seen Ken Sanders on television from his fourteen years as a rare books and manuscripts appraiser on the popular PBS show, Antiques Roadshow. Ken’s bookshop is an integral part of the very fabric of Utah’s culture. His store is under very real threats, most immediately with the loss of sales due to the Covid-19 crisis that has the store running at approximately 50% of normal sales. We know we are not alone in this, but the pandemic shows no sign of going away any time soon. Please do help by donating to this fundraising campaign, we can’t afford to lose this cultural icon! KSRB is a place that its community has depended on for many years to provide vital resources by way of literature, poetry, music, art, specializing in Utah, Mormon, Native American, and Western history. It carries new, used, and rare books, paper ephemera, photographs, maps, rock and roll posters, letterhead broadsides, t-shirts, and things you never dreamed existed. The store champions natural history and environment, climate change, social justice, sustainability, radical politics, to name a few subjects near and dear to our hearts. Alternative voices, minorities, women, LGBTQ+, everyone is included. In addition to curating collections, appraising books and manuscripts, Ken has contributed to the book publishing world through Dream Garden Press, founded in 1980, to publish regional poets and authors. The store has hosted thousands of events that include concerts by musicians, poetry readings, book release celebrations, and film showings. To name only a few: Edward Abbey, Charles Bowden, Terry Tempest Williams, Wendell Berry, Tom Russell, Rosalie Sorrells, Utah Phillips, and Alex Caldiero’s dazzling performances of Allen Ginsberg’s Howl. Ken specializes in oral story telling, occasional writing, and has been featured in dozens of films and documentaries on notable subjects such as Edward Abbey, Tim DeChristopher, Everett Ruess, Ken Sleight, and Earth First! We’re hoping this GoFundMe campaign will carry the store operations through this worst of times. Funds will be used for employee payroll, employee health insurance, rents, basic store operations, and supplies needed to reduce the risks of Covid-19 to ensure the welfare of the staff and customers. We are deeply grateful to our loyal fans and customers and appreciate both the love and the financial support you have sent our way.  We encourage you to visit the store’s website to learn more about the store’s inventory and activities.Rare Books Need Rare Humans!There are a few reasons why you might contribute to help save Ken Sanders Rare Books which has become endangered due to the Covid-19 epidemic. You might contribute because you know or have met Ken Sanders personally. Maybe you know him as the gentle soul he is - whose dedication to books, art, nature, history and boundless curiosity have proven a priceless, positive contribution to the business of book selling and also to the world.You might contribute because you have a connection to Utah, Salt Lake City, the West and you appreciate the fact that Ken Sanders Rare Books is a portal unlike many other that still exist. Maybe you understand these bookstores and the people that run them are being pulverized between technology and Covid-19 and that being able to spend an afternoon physically rambling through musty stacks is an experience that needs to be preserved.Maybe you’ve seen Ken on Antiques Roadshow and get a kick out the fact that he could expound with deep understanding exactly why and how the 1930 Rockwell Kent illustrated edition of Moby Dick can possibly be worth so much money.Or maybe you’re just a reader and book lover and want to kick in.In any of these cases your contribution will be appreciated and put to good work. Thanks for being a part of saving Ken Sanders Rare Books!  WRITTEN TESTIMONIALS….In a forest, under the ground, there are networks of fungus fibers that connect the roots of trees together, allowing the trees to share information and resources. They're called mycorrhizal networks and they help keep the whole forest healthy. Ken Sanders Rare Books is like one of these underground networks. You walk into his store and you feel connected to healthy forest. Ken is the gnome who guards it. The Amazon Corporation is named after a forest but it has no underground, no roots or fungus. It’s more like a virus that kills trees. If Ken’s store closes, the forest dies. Simple as that, and tragic as the loss of a species. So I will work to help the store stay open. Scott Carrier, Journalist__________________________________________________________________________________________I think of Ken Sanders, as do most who know him, as worthy ofState Treasure status standing as he does at Utah cultural crossroadswhere desert rats, intellectuals, misfits, artists, writers, book worms,poets, philosophers come to weave tales with Ken and discover a newauthor, or a new trail of thinking. The bookshop is where we take visitors when we hope to answer the question:""Why Utah?"" posed by relatives and meaningful friends. They don't knowthat in our minds Ken is a sort of right of passage. If they gasp in wonder atKSRB-- they understand Why-- if they don't -- they never will. I have been a bookstore nut from the time I found Watkins, Foylesin London - Thorpes in Guildford and Hay on Wye in the 60s.They in their turn defined their time and place and reflected the British character for generations. The British bookstore, however, is genteel.  A thing of winter, tea and muffins,wooly scarves, cats and damp tweed.  KSRB is more sand in your hiking boots, thirst, chapstick, rocks in your pockets and brain sort of experience.   For years now I have been ranting on about the misguided plan for developmenton the site of our Utah Treasure. I can only hope that one outcome of this dreadful pandemic and inevitable Depression is that developers will not have their way with the land where Ken's Bookshop stands. It is our best mental watering hole.  Jann Haworth, Artist__________________________________________________________________________________________I can easier imagine a cordiality truce between Mormon crickets and seagulls than a closing of Ken Sanders Rare Books.  Name one other place in Salt Lake City where you can go for a thoroughly invigorating browsing and at the same time get a better half hour gym workout than Ken’s Place, and simultaneously—even though it may be unearned—be greeted and treated as an old friend.  KSRB is a SLC institution with an earned reputation for both inventory and eccentricity and our world would be diminished should this bookstore disappear.That said, as we all know, times are genuinely tough and Ken is having an even harder time than usual holding Yeats’ archetypal center together.  Now it’s time for us to render service and help an old and dear friend out.  I’m going to do my part and make a painful sacrifice: give up a minimum of three days’ worth of Happy Hour in his honor.  I cannot imagine a Utah world worth living in without Ken’s hanging in and being there as a visible icon; can you?David Lee, Apprentice World Class Piddler and Scribbler__________________________________________________________________________________________ I can’t recall the first time I met Ken Sanders, book dealer, river runner, cultural icon. But I remember all the moments since.I remember when he commissioned a family river trip with Moki Mak through Desolation Canyon, with fellow bookman Ken Lopez and his family, writer Scott Carrier and two of his young children, and invited me and the Peacocks: Doug, Laurel and Colin. It was my first big river, and 20 years later still ranks as one of my favorite trips.In the early 2000s, he hosted me for a reading at his store when I published my first book, Libby, Montana: Asbestos and the Deadly Silence of an American Corporation, about the death and destruction that the WR Grace Corporation wrought upon a small, working class town in rural Montana. I was a unknown Montana journalist., He had no reason to expect a profit from that event, but knew it was a story that needed to be told.A few years later, Doug needed back surgery and had no one in Salt Lake to take care of him. Ken took him to and from the airport and the hospital, made sure he had a place to recover and fed him all the while. Then, in 2010, Doug’s cousin Marc Beaudin and I had this half-baked plan to open a used bookstore in Livingston, Montana. Ken graciously, generously answered our questions from Day 1, and saw us through those first rocky years, providing references for scholarships, guiding us through our first book fairs, and ultimately sponsoring our application to the Antiquarian Bookstore Association of America. There is no better ambassador in America for the next generation of rare book dealers.Ken Sanders is simply irreplaceable.Andrea Peacock, Author, Activist, Bookseller__________________________________________________________________________________________ Few bookstores still exist that satisfy the craving for the smell of old paper, places where you can nose through stacks and magically, the book you need appears, even if it’s not the one you came in for. References and histories, rare books on order, entrance busy with every manner of human from the drunk to the erudite, and sometimes drunkenly erudite. If your city is fortunate enough to have one of these, I’d do everything I could to keep it.The community of Ken Sanders Rare Books extends past this city to all of the West, part of my life in my little dot of Colorado, and part of so many more authors’ lives, an avenue for counterculture and wilderness. Stories have poured through here to packed houses, every aisle and seat filled, a microphone up front, a reader, a singer on guitar, or sometimes only a handful in the audience, each rapt, so glad they came. Run by Ken Sanders himself, bearded guffawing laureate of literature from the Rockies to the sea, this shop is a cultural necessity. Historians may talk someday of how western society was nudged along by this man, by the tales he promoted and the eclectic range of books he brought to us. Keep this place alive. Don't give it new digs or put its name up in lights. Keep it as is. The next generation will need it even more.Craig Childs, Performance Author__________________________________________________________________________________________The pulse tells you a lot about the health of a body. A bookstore is the pulse of a city. KSRB has been telling us a lot about the health of local culture. At this time, the health of the city is not good. This is reflected in the health of our bookstores, and especially KSRB. For the past 24 years (a family-owned shop since 1997), KSRB has held its own. Now it needs a helping hand.This is not just a “book store” I’m talking about; not merely a venue for books. There are stores with books in them, and there are “book stores” (stores that sell books, as some stores sell shoes, or fish, or groceries). Then again there is the real McCoy: BOOKSTORE (one word). Today, there are fewer and fewer “bookstores”, that is to say, not merely a venue that sells books, but a PLACE where books wait for readers, and create a backdrop for cultural exchanges that promote art, poetry, film, and literary events. Add to these, rare and the collectible objects and artifacts, and you have a BOOKSTORE: KEN SANDERS RARE BOOKS, the real McCoy.On a personal note: my life both as reader and writer, would be a lot poorer if I had never entered this place. The major interactions and contacts with my community of readers and fellow poets/writers/filmmakers/ has been fostered by the physics of this place. This “bookstore” and the soul of the place, Ken Sanders himself: flesh and voice and beard ever growing wild.Given all of the above, to say that I endorse KSRB and efforts to save it, is an understatement. Let my voice join the chorus: LONG LIVE KSRB and may we preserve the health of our Salt Lake City.Alex Caldiero,Senior Artist in Residence at UVU and ever, your friendly naybohood sonosopher___________________________________________________________________________________________ Exploring Ken’s book store is like going on a weird Safari in a library after an earthquake.  There are books piled high, books tumbling down, books that rattle your very foundation. It is exciting and dangerous and it is one of my favorite places in the whole damn universe.  The universe needs Ken’s book store to keep things in balance.  If the store goes the way of the wind it could mean the end of the world!  It is not just an institution, it is a vortex of madness, a depository of all the great ideas that have ever been and an incubator for the brilliance to come.  Hell, Ken even sells my movies!  Trent Harris, Filmmaker"

When I think of the many roads I took to become your bookseller here in Lenox, I cannot imagine who or what else I might have become. It’s always felt to me a perfect fit, and to judge from the loyalty you have shown through the years, you think so, too. With that in mind I am appealing today for your help.As busy as we are every day – and yes, we are thankful we’re busy - the fact is this: business is down, way down.  Sales each week are what they used to be each day.Our well-known slogan says that The Bookstore has been Serving the Community Since Last Tuesday, but as many of you know I’ve actually been here since April 1, 1976, sitting at that front desk, happy to provide you with all those things that make our bookstore The Bookstore: the book you may not have known but fell in love with; the glass of wine at Get Lit; the poetry reading or book signing event that reminds you of the large presence in your life that is this small shop on Housatonic Street.We belong to each other, you and I. If you live nearby we usually see you pretty regularly. If you’re a part-timer, or a summer renter, or a weekender or just an accidental visitor, chances are if you came through our door once, you’ve probably come back again and again. In the old days I might have sold books to your parents or grandparents.  Today I’m selling them, curbside, to you, to your children and grandchildren.  But if I want to continue, and if you want me to continue, I am going to need your help.  The challenge is real and it is immediate. Government PPP was eaten up, just as it was supposed to be, by payroll and utilities early in the game. Curbside revenue doesn’t begin to cover the day-to-day expenses like rent, payroll, utilities, insurance and all the other costs of doing business. Until we can safely open our doors again, and I just don’t know when that will be, I most humbly ask you to help me get through.  My aim, my pledge to you remains the same as it’s ever been -  to offer the best in the world of books.  But Covid-19 is more formidable than anything we’ve ever faced.We’ve posted on our website over a hundred photos of the books on tables and shelves and will continue to do so until it’s safe for you to come in and browse. Safe for you, safe for me.  I know you understand.My predecessor started The Bookstore on a small loan from a family friend. That was 54 years ago.  I took over ten years later, and with your help, your devotion, and your commitment, we have made The Bookstore into an institution worthy of its reputation.  It’s yours as much as it is mine.None of us would even want to imagine it no longer being here.Our goal is to raise $60,000.  That will wipe out the shortfall from this spring and summer, and allow us to continue “serving the community since last Tuesday”.I thank you, as they say, madly, truly, deeply, for your support and look forward to many more years as your bookseller here at The Bookstore in Lenox.  And don’t be shy about sharing this link; we can use all the help we can get.Thanks for reading. Be well. Be safeMatt Tannenbaumhttp://bookstoreinlenox.com/#smallbusinessrelief

Like many businesses on June 1st during the Fordham riots, our stores were looted, emptied, vandalized, and destroyed. As immigrants that built our lives here, our livelihood was taken away in one night. We ask first that everyone please be safe for us and any and all donations will be used to rebuild our businesses, medical expenses, and pay back our customers whose items were stolen that night. We are navigating the world of police reports, a totalled car, an unclear insurance situation, and losing the vast majority of our inventory. We greatly appreciate the generosity. Our story from that night..We were stuck trying to securely close the store but looters came in hordes and forced open our store gate and flooded in. We tried to get out. We tried to keep important items safe. But they saw. As we tried to get into our car, they attacked us. They smashed our windows. They attacked with crowbars, pipes, and bricks. They pulled my mom from the car. As my boyfriend Chao held onto her, they broke her leg. My jewelry, shoes, and phone were torn from me as they pulled me out from the trunk of the car while Chao tried to hold me in. My dad tried to fight them off and when we were finally able to drive away, they followed us. They got into their cars and tried to ram us off the road. We sped towards the police barricade and as the police surrounded us the looters drove away.Black lives matter. Black communities matter. This movement matters. These protests matter. We need to bring justice to the lives lost and healing to the communities. The Fordham community needs healing now. Please support the families and businesses that have been affected. I thank everyone that has come to the aid of my family and the heroes that work at St. Barnabas Hospital and SeniorCare EMS.We appreciate all your thoughts and prayers and generosity.

Our vision was (and still is) to make it possible for musicians to play live in sync from different locations over the Internet - as if sitting in the same room. Along the way, we added things like the ability to play along with your favorite songs, live broadcast performances, teach/take music lessons, and more.We invested a good chunk of our own money into this vision, and on top of this worked full-time literally for years with no pay to get JamKazam off the ground. We also managed to raise a little bit of money from outside investors, but honestly not nearly enough to achieve our vision. There is so much more we could do to make this service easier to use, significantly reduce latency (lag) in sessions, deliver great new features, and provide better support for our users. Unfortunately, at this point we have all been forced to take regular full-time jobs to support ourselves and our families, and we are running low on funds just to continue to pay the cash expenses to keep JamKazam running - things like hosting fees, royalties, and all the usual things needed to operate a business like this.We recognize it's a bad time to ask for help, given that millions of people are hurting financially and emotionally right now, but we need assistance to keep JamKazam operational. And we need more help if we are going to do more than keep it alive - to drive it forward to better meet the needs of the worldwide community of musicians. As we consider our options, we are also taking into account that musicians need JamKazam more than ever, as none of us can meet up in the same place to play together. And this is likely to continue to be the case - at least in phases - for quite some time. We want to help, and this is how we can best do it.If you decide to contribute funds to support JamKazam’s mission, we will use these funds to improve the service. A short list of things we’d like to be able to do, depending on the level of support from this GoFundMe, include:Reduce Internet LatencyWe’ve had a solution on the drawing board for years now to reduce Internet latency between musicians significantly. We’ve conducted experiments that prove we can do this, and recently we’ve built the technology to do it. But we do not have the capital to deploy this technology. This is at or near the top of our list and is key to making JamKazam work better for more musicians and bands.Guarantee Session ConnectionsMany of you have noticed that sometimes other users are “grayed out” in your sessions, and audio won’t stream between musicians when this happens. This issue is caused by the networking approach we use, and this problem would be fixed by the same Internet latency reduction we described in the bullet above. We can make network connections work in 99%+ of sessions. Provide Better SupportRight now we cannot provide any support to our users. We simply do not have the time and are very overwhelmed by the surge in the use of the service. We’d like to have someone available to provide support, but we would need to be able to compensate someone for doing this. At the least, we’d like to produce more and better help documentation.Fix Bugs & Improve User InterfaceThe user interface on the JamKazam application was never great to begin with, and it has not aged well. The app would benefit from a UI refresh. The whole app would also benefit from a comprehensive testing process that identifies all the bugs that have cropped up over time, and a dedicated effort to fix these bugs to make the application more stable and reliable. Help Musicians to Generate IncomeAnother area where we can help is to improve JamKazam’s broadcast features to enable bands to generate income from performances, and to enable music teachers to generate income from higher quality lessons online.What Else?We have plenty of other ideas of great things we can do, and we will also most definitely continue to listen to all of you – our JamKazammers – to help guide our path forward. All of your feedback over the years has helped the JamKazam service to become what it is today.Thanks to everyone for taking the time to consider supporting this JamKazam GoFundMe. We believe in the power of music and its importance in people’s lives. We hope you'll join us in the work of helping musicians play together and share their art and performances with fans everywhere.Best Regards and Stay Safe,David, Peter, and Seth(the JamKazam co-founders)---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------p.s. Here are some links to videos that show more of what JamKazam can do:Watch how 6 bands played together from different locations in Austin at our Virtual Jamfest launch See how far we have pushed the envelope with a band playing live from Chicago Austin Brooklyn and Atlanta Learn how you can play along with your favorite bands and songs  Consider teaching music lessons on JamKazam with far better audio quality and far lower latency than Zoom Live broadcast your performances on YouTube Facebook and Twitch for fun or use our integrated ticketing features to generate income We cannot produce the JamBlaster product due to a lack of capital but it is nifty

We've been here for professional cooks, home cooks, food writers, and anyone else who wanted to be part of that community.(Above: a scene from our annual clean-out event, where we sell old and damaged books cheaply to good homes. 50% of the money raised that way in past years has gone to Edible Schoolyard NYC.)Now,  however, our survival is at risk, and we have to turn to you for help. Our usual sources of income—everyday customers, major food conferences, restaurant chefs—have all been dealt staggering blows. Without them, we’re not coming close to paying our bills.We want to keep Kitchen Arts & Letters open. We want to keep bringing you the important, groundbreaking, and unusual books from home and abroad, and the personal service that tells you we love what we do here.We have a vision for going forward that builds on all we’ve been to our community through the decades. We’ want to become even more useful to food and drink people by  making our website faster, easier to use, and a more complete reflection of our full inventory. We want expand our searches for books you won’t find elsewhere. And we will continue to tightly control our costs. But to be brutally honest, without outside support we’ll have to close our doors in the near future.A bookstore run for and by people who really care about food and drink booksWhen we opened in 1983, store founder Nach Waxman greeted many people who poked their heads in, among them a man who looked around and declared, “It’ll never last,” then wished Nach good luck and left.But the store became a destination spot. Nach remembers Julia Child walking in, kicking off her shoes, and sitting down on the floor to inspect the contents of the French section. We became the place where you can find not only classics like Julia’s books, but fascinating passion projects written by authors who self-published because they couldn’t interest a big publishing house. The place to find books imported from England, France, Spain, Italy, Japan, Australia, Ecuador, and Argentina.Our basement—the marvelous treasure-trove basement, from which Nach extracts countless out-of-print volumes, some to consult, some for sale—became a legend.And every day that we’ve been open, we’ve been helping people find the right books for their needs. Not necessarily the most popular or famous books, but the ones that matched someone’s skills and ambitions.That’s what’s made these decades so satisfying. (Above: Visiting authors have included chefs like Massimo Bottura and Ferran Adrià)We’re at a crisis pointThe pandemic hit New York City hard. Many of our core customers have been devastated by restaurant closings. In-store traffic stopped for many months and has only weakly revived as people have, rightly, remained cautious.  We’ve kept hoping there will be some dramatic improvement in our fortunes. And now our lease has to be renewed. Nach and Matt agreed early on that the one thing we would not do is lay off our staff, two brilliantly talented and helpful part-timers who had already lost the incomes they made working in food service.But otherwise we’ve cut our costs as deeply as we can while retaining the character that has made us valuable. We can’t cut more without ceasing to be Kitchen Arts & Letters.(Above: We're proud to have hosted authors such as Stella Parks and Andrea Nguyen, who brought food!)Please help us stay aliveWe want to remain the place you find the books you were always looking for, the place that has the books you never dreamed existed. We want to delight you with books signed right here in the store by your favorite authors. We want to do for you exactly what a specialist bookstore is supposed to do: connect you to an amazing, ever-growing world of first-rate books.We want you to be able to walk in the door and be immediately distracted by an offbeat new publication. We want you to visit and overhear a pastry chef from Japan talking to a food writer from Pennsylvania. We want to help you find a recipe for the stew that grandpa learned to make growing up in Poland but never wrote down.And we want to continue to send you news of great books, new and old, that deserve attention because of the work of extraordinary authors.So we’re asking for whatever help you can give us to survive this crisis, endure in the idiosyncratic style that we’ve been known for, and evolve to be an even better resource for you. Financial support would be wonderful. So would be sharing the news of our campaign.And if we fail in this effort, please know that we’re profoundly grateful for the amazing world we’ve been part of for all these decades. Food really does bring out the best in people and we’ve been privileged to see it in our friends and customers.Nach WaxmanFounding PartnerMatt SartwellManaging Partner

My name is Kiley Clark and I come from a long line of farmers and earth workers, a legacy I am very proud of. My ancestors live on through me.I am a farmer, food advocate, chef, writer and photographer. I have been working in agriculture for the last five years, studying organic and sustainable farming practice and documenting the lives of farmers through my writing and photography. In 2019, I visited over 30 farms in five western states, listening to the stories and highlighting the experiences of farmers. With Black farm ownership at only 2% in the United States and with threats to agricultural systems and widespread food insecurity, now is the time to set forth on a dream I have been cultivating for the last decade. I am currently searching for land to start my own farm while writing and researching the challenges facing new and aspiring farmers, especially Black farmers.I have always dreamed of working on my own land. As a Black, queer, woman land ownership has felt evasive for much of my life, not having the capital or the generational wealth to make this possible. I want to build a dream together, founded on regenerative, no till practices and paying homage to the traditional ecology knowledge of my ancestors, and the land’s original Indigenous caretakers. I am building seed fund to start a small scale farm, and I need your help. The seed money we raise will contribute to:- the down payment on a 3-10 acre property;- start up costs for farm equipment such as walk behind tractor, seeders, hand tools;- farm infrastructure such as irrigation, wash house and coolers.If possible, I would love to stay on the west coast where I have a large network of farm, restaurant and agricultural community.  We are meeting with brokers and exploring different avenues throughout California, Oregon and Washington. Where ever we build, we will be contributing in monthly land tax and forging partnerships with Indigenous community. 2020 is the year!Why now? In this time of horrific pain and reckoning over systemic racism in this country, it is crucial to not just support Black people in our deaths. You must also support Black joy, uplift Black liberation and invest in Black-led organizations and entrepreneurs. The farm I am building will be a community hub, a place where Queer folx can get their hands in the dirt, where our communities can thrive, laugh, and be fed. We’re building this dream together and I can't wait to welcome you all around my future farm table!

The  business owners of Saigon Bay Vietnamese Restaurant are grateful to the community for any funds they receive. 

On May 30th, 2020 protests for the brutal death of George Floyd by a white police officer in MN started peacefully on Fowler Avenue in Tampa, FL.

By nightfall, riots started with looting and burning of buildings. Rioters set fire to Champs adjacent to Saigon Bay Vietnamese Restaurant. Both buildings (connected in a strip mall) were destroyed/damaged severely. Please donate to Thanh Son and  Savy Lam: owners of Saigon Bay Vietnamese Restaurant on Fowler Avenue in Tampa, FL. This business is their livelihood to support a multi-generational family! They did not deserve this setback. They are so kind, welcoming, and inclusive to everyone. Please support them during this time. 

All donations will go directly to Thanh and Savy to support their restaurant. Thank you in advance!

With full reopening still to come at a very limited capacity, we are asking for your support as we navigate this uncertain future and try to keep our doors open. Established in 1950, the Kettle of Fish has a literary history as being the local watering hole for Beat writers including Jack Kerouac, musicians including Bob Dylan, and eclectic Greenwich Village artists and bohemians. Originally opened on MacDougal Street, the Kettle moved twice and just celebrated its 70th birthday on June 8th, with 21 years in the heart of Greenwich Village at 59 Christopher Street. Kettle of Fish is also a globally known destination bar for visitors to watch Green Bay Packers football games, so much so that Packers Quarterback Aaron Rodgers paid an off-season visit in 2019, and previously other Packer greats such as Jerry Kramer, John Brockington, and Dave Robinson have stopped by for games, camaraderie, and meet-and-greets. With boisterous group singing, Usinger’s brats, and a group of passionate gameday regulars, it’s a unique experience.Whether you are looking for a place to grab a pint and read on an afternoon, meet up with friends for a few after a long week, or just Wisconsin sports fans watching the Badgers, Brewers, or Bucks (oh my!), all are welcome at the Kettle of Fish. The cultural significance of the Kettle of Fish in this historic district, and on this street in particular, exemplifies New York City’s dedication to diversity in all forms. With iconic Greenwich Village institutions in danger of disappearing due to this pandemic, we ask our fans, friends and community to help keep us here for years to come! Another way you can help is to spread the message!

Shortly after, he watched rioters broke into it again and burned it to the rubbles. He watched until the cameras burned and the feed stopped.  Chicago Lake Family Dental had been eagerly gearing up to open its doors to patients once again after the COVID-19 stay at home orders.Now the office is facing a new and bigger challenge. Dr. Ali opened his clinic in this location, in the heart of South Minneapolis, because he wanted to serve the neighborhood. Dr. Ali and his wife have two beautiful young daughters, and he was passionate about ensuring that other children had the same access to quality care as his daughters. His clinic had a dedicated kid’s play area, that he created to help kids not only get access to quality care, but to make the experience of visiting the dentist an enjoyable one. The clinic is one of a handful of critical access dental providers in the southside community, providing dental care for undeserved, underprivileged, children and uninsured patients. The surrounding community will suffer with the loss of this community resource, as access to affordable dental care is already a challenge for many in urban and underprivileged areas like this one. Donations will be used to help the dental staff and their families, as they are now without jobs, and will be used to rebuild the clinic as soon as possible, so that they can get back to work in serving the community. Please show those who want to destroy our great city and its resources that they won’t win.  Dr. Ali is very grateful and humbled by the support shown so far.

I’m raising funding for Honeysuckle, a multifaceted community center where Black food puts its flag on a plate and stakes a claim for space in America—because America won’t acknowledge and give it that space.I’m seeking to raise $250,000 for a space that will ideally be located in the Mantua section of West Philadelphia, where the average cost of a commercial property hovers around $180,000. The remaining funds will be used for staff, repairs, equipment, and beautification of the space to open in early 2022.The Honeysuckle community center will include a grocery, meat market, cafe library, and supper club. Food spaces need to be reinvented to serve more than good food. Honeysuckle will use history, the arts, education, agriculture, commerce, and food to pursue its mission.All supporters will receive a gift of unique art as a token of gratitude for your investment in the future of Honeysuckle. If you contribute $100 or more to this project, you will receive a Honeysuckle bean pie in the mail. Why a bean pie? I grew up muslim, initially under the teachings of The Nation of Islam. The Nation of Islam sold bean pies to help raise funds for the organization as well as to spark dialogue about who we are as African Americans post-Jim Crow. The bean pie is a representation of a new cultural identity, a new narrative, and a new line of thought.The project will not only engage with the community but also build and grow into the fabric of the community already established in West Philadelphia for generations to come. I will employ its residents, share a collective wealth, and create and display art that represents us, resulting in being seen as human and powerful. To be allowed to own our destiny.Honeysuckle is a continuation of my grandpa James Jamison’s legacy of community activism. In the 1970s, Grandpa James came home from the Vietnam War and opened a community center in South Philadelphia that promoted the arts and taught and fed the neighborhood’s children. It never realized its full potential due to racial tensions in the city at the time. With your support, I intend to bring his and my dream to full fruition by creating a place that nourishes the community, where neighbors can meet and bond over food.Thank you.PRESS""Mr. Tate ... quilts cultural history and his own memories into a celebration of the Black American past."" - The New York Times ""Before COVID-19, Omar Tate opened a portal to Blackness with his lauded pop-up Honeysuckle.

The 8x10 needs your help.For those that don’t know about The 8x10, we are a live music venue in Baltimore, Md. Under various owners, the location in Federal Hill neighborhood has been providing a home for live music since 1983. My wife Abigail Janssens and myself, Brian Shupe have owned and operated it since 2005.The 8x10 is legendary for its intimacy, its pristine sound, and most of all, its rabid and fiercely loyal fanbase. We get told all the time by bands that we are their favorite venue east of the Mississippi. We have poured our souls into the venue to live up to those standards and provide a fertile ground for bands and audiences to connect seamlessly.The 8x10 shut its doors on March 13th 2020 and has been dark ever since. Being an entertainment venue, we are going to be the last industry to recover. While bars and restaurants have been open for several months, we just have been permitted to open at 25% capacity.The problem breaks down into two main issues. Safety and Revenue.SAFETY ISSUESThe last thing we are going to do is create a situation where our family of customers, bands, and employees get sick. We have been going back and forth about when would it be safe to open, when the outbreak at The White House happened, that put everything into perspective. How fast it spread, How many people were infected from one little gathering. And that was outdoors. The 8x10 is a small venue. There is hardly any way to socially distance. Even with lower capacity, masks, temperature checks, if someone unknowingly came to a show, The 8x10 would be a super spreader. We couldn’t live with that.REVENUE ISSUESRight now we can open at 25% capacity. Do I want to put my staff at risk of bringing home COVID-19 to their children or elderly parents for 25% of their usual tips? Our doorman is going to have to interact with every single patron multiple times a night, what kind of risk is that? But that isn’t even the tip of the iceberg. Where are we going to get bands? Bands aren’t touring yet out of fear and simply not being able to find enough venues that are allowed to open. Is a band that usually plays to 300 people and makes a couple thousand dollars going to be able to cover the exact same expenses from 25% of their normal ticket sales? And are you the public going to risk coming to shows? What should we do? Should we start charging four times as much for the tickets to make up the difference? We just can’t stomach charging $60 to our faithful patrons for the same show they normally pay $15 to attend. There are no easy answers.COST OF DOING BUSINESSMeanwhile, we are still paying our expenses to the tune of $15,000 a month. Our rent alone is $10k a month. Every month. Our landlord has been very generous to offer us some relief and has promised us he will do everything he can to ensure The 8x10 survives this, but he is struggling too. The 8x10 is all about doing the right thing, and we can’t run out on our commitment to him or any of our other vendors and monthly responsibilities. Rent, Gas & Electric, Insurance, Telephone, Internet, yada yada yada.We were lucky. We got an emergency relief loan through the government and we have been able to meet our responsibilities up to now. And we can still make it but probably only to the end of the year. But this is a loan, not a grant. It is not a forgivable package, but a loan. That means after working so hard and struggling to serve the community for 15 years, once we had finally pulled our head above water, COVID-19 struck and derailed our retirement plans and now were are once again in debt. The $150,000 dollars that has been keeping The 8x10 from bankruptcy is going to have to be repaid and it is going to come out of Abigail’s and my pocket. It’s the cost of doing business and we know it. But the government is not helping our industry. Live music venues, movie theaters, theaters for plays and musicals are all suffering the most and going to be the last industry to recover. Since there is no second round of loans or aid on the horizon, it has come to this. We have to turn to the people that come to, and play at The 8x10 for help.We hate the fact that we are asking for charity, but if comes down to begging or letting The 8x10 disappear due to some pandemic…We have no pride. We will do whatever it takes to keep The 8x10 alive for our community of music lovers. There is no shame in that. If there was another way, believe me we would be doing it.OUR GOALHonestly, we know 2020 has been a screw job on everybody and finances are tough for everyone. We are just hoping that Many Hands Make Light Work. There have been hundreds of thousands of people that have come through the doors of The 8x10. If we can spread the financial burden of keeping The 8x10 solvent over all the people who have come and had their minds blown by the magic coming off the stage, celebrated with their friends a marriage, birth, promotion, birthday, or just that it is a Friday night. If we can spread it out over the thousands of bands that have played there over the years and told us how much they love The 8x10. If everyone who has ever been touched by what The 8x10 does can just donate what they can afford then the burden won’t seem so heavy.Our bare minimum goal would be to put six more months of expenses into savings. Maybe just maybe by then we will have a vaccine or some semblance of our normal lives back. But in March we were sure it would be over by June. In August we were saying it has to be better by October, yet nothing has changed.Whatever we can raise we will be grateful for. I can tell you that every cent of the money will go to expenses at The 8x10 first and foremost. If by some miracle we are able to open soon, 100% of the remainder of the money will go to paying back the $150k loan.  We need your help. We need you to spread this website to every person you know. Do you have a contact with any of the big bands that played The 8x10 back when they were coming up? Send them a link, ask them to give back if they can. Do you have a contact with a music magazine or online community? Represent for us and tell them what we stand for and ask if they can throw us a few.Please, please know that we are only asking for you to give an amount that makes sense for your situation. Every donation will add up, so please don’t try and be a hero and end up putting strain on your situation.This is such a horrible situation. We have put 15 years of our blood, sweat, tears, and love into The 8x10. And you have put the same effort into coming and supporting us by seeing show after show. None of us want The 8x10 to go under.

     The Plaza Tavern has been a downtown Madison staple since 1930.  It has hosted countless Badger tailgates, wedding parties, student get togethers, fundraisers, and family gatherings. Mary and Harold Huss created the Plaza Sauce recipe in 1963 that is still being enjoyed today. The business was passed to their children Tom, Kathy, Peg and Jim in the mid 80’s. The current owner Dean Hetue started working for the family in 1980. Both Erica DeRosa and Ian Miller started In the mid 90’s and were in the process of taking the reigns of ownership when the impact of COVID-19 derailed the business.      With limited or no indoor/outdoor seating, the revenue from carry and delivery food is a fraction of The Plaza’s overhead. Any funds created will First cover the basic monthly costs of being open. As restrictions ease and The Plaza can open more to the public, any funds received will help with hiring new staff until a time the business can sustain itself.  

   Dean, Erica and Ian have been volunteering their time without pay  to continue serving the Plaza food so many have grown to love. While they are committed to keeping the tradition alive, this isn’t sustainable for an extended  period of time. Financial help has come from many of the wonderful regulars and friends, and has been greatly appreciated and needed. Go Fund Me will hopefully add the broader reach needed to make it through this difficult spot in Plaza history. 

       The Plaza needs your help to remain alive. Whether you donate yourself or send the link to all your friends, you can’t imagine how much it is appreciated. Thank you for being part of The Plaza legacy!

I was still dressed in my running clothes. And as I neared my home, I passed by a 76-year old woman dressed in a floor length faux mink coat. She was gripping tightly to a railing. ‘You look great,’ I told her.  Then she pointed at my own clothes— ‘Let me ask you a question,’ she said. ‘Why is it always white boys who wear shorts in the winter?’And thus began my friendship with Stephanie. One of Stephanie's more endearing  traits is that she will launch into a wild story within seconds of meeting a person-- often before customary greetings are exchanged. And that's exactly what she did. She began telling me stories from the 1970's, when she worked as a burlesque dancer named Tanqueray. Her memory for detail was amazing, and she had a singular way of describing things. Stephanie will say the wildest things without a hint of self-consciousness. It really has a way of drawing you in. And after she'd been going for about five minutes, I interrupted for long enough to ask if I could run to my house and get my camera.  The resulting interview went quite viral, as many of you will remember. And Stephanie had a lot of fun with it.  People were stopping her on the street all day long. And Stephanie loves an audience-- even if it’s just an audience of one. So anyone who stopped her for a selfie would leave ten minutes later with an earful of stories. And what stories they were.  Nobody has lived a life like Stephanie’s. The two of us agreed to meet regularly at a nearby diner, so I could get her whole story down on paper. We did about twenty interviews together. Our initial plan was to create a podcast. But after we'd gone quite a distance down that path, circumstances suddenly changed. Stephanie has been in pain for as long as I've known her. When we first met she was walking with a cane. And every time we walked to the diner, she'd grip tightly to my arm. Even then-- it would take us fifteen minutes to travel half a block. She’d wince in pain whenever she was jostled or bumped. Occasionally she’d scream out. It was clear that something was seriously wrong with her leg. She attributed the injury to a bad fall that she'd suffered a few months earlier, but she seemed confident that she was on the mend. When the pandemic started, Stephanie and I continued our conversations over the phone. She would call me several times a day. And whenever I didn't answer, she'd always leave a voicemail—usually telling me some story she’d just remembered. Last month I grew concerned when a few days passed without hearing from her. I called a neighbor to check up on her, and he heard Stephanie's voice coming from the back bedroom. She'd taken a bad fall and had been on the floor for 72 hours without food or water. The EMTs broke down her door and took her to the hospital. Ever since the fall, Stephanie has been unable to stand or walk. She is in a lot of pain. She's always been  a private person in many ways, but the current crisis has necessitated a candor about her situation. We’ve hired a team of professionals to make her apartment clean and comfortable. We’ve gotten her a 24-hour home health aide. She now has a physical therapist coming to the apartment multiple times a week.  And we're working on handling the back rent and eviction notices. Her health is not improving as quickly as we'd like, but Stephanie remains absolutely convinced that she is on the mend. Unfortunately her unorthodox lifestyle hasn't qualified her for social security. And she doesn’t currently have insurance. (Though we're trying to get her signed up for Medicare.) Her care is extremely expensive. So far I’ve been using funds from the HONY Patreon, but it’s not sustainable long term.   Stephanie and I have decided to scrap our idea of making a podcast. And I’ve spent the last few weeks retooling the story for publication on Humans of New York. Our plan is to raise funds for Stephanie’s care alongside the telling of her story. The ultimate goal is for Stephanie to live the rest of her life on her own terms. Maybe that means an assisted living facility. Maybe that means remaining in her apartment with the assistance of a home health aide. I’m not sure. But I want to provide her with enough resources so that it’s her decision, and not a decision forced upon her. But I’m not viewing this as charity. Stephanie brings a priceless resource to the table—her story. We're just going to tell that story using a new model.  Instead of selling advertising, or selling it to a publisher, we’re asking for voluntary contributions from anyone who’s gotten value from Stephanie’s narrative. If the story of her life has made you laugh, or cry, or think—please consider compensating the person who lived it. Because right now her story is the one thing she has to offer.We are being very thoughtful with the money. Stephanie knows that there are risks involved with publicly raising funds for a person in her vulnerable situation. So with her blessing, we will be placing the money in a trust to ensure that it provides sustainable, long term care. The trust will cover her living expenses and health care needs moving forward. (Which will admittedly be quite extensive.) And at Stephanie’s request, any money remaining at the end of her life will be donated to The Association To Benefit Children —a highly respected New York charity dedicated to helping the city’s most vulnerable children.Please consider joining us as we seek to transform Stephanie’s life.----------------------------------------------------------Humans of New York is audience supported.If you would like to support Humans of New York, you can do so by joining the Patreon.

Please click the box labelled 'Don't display my name publicly on the campaign' to prevent anyone from scraping and misusing your information.The General Defense Committe Local 1 in Portland, Oregon, has established a fundraiser to cover bail and other legal expenses for protesters arrested in Portland, Oregon in connection to protests against George Floyd's murder by Minneapolis police, along with general police brutality. If you get arrested or the police visit or call you because of the protests, please contact the GDC at [email redacted] or 503-442-0866. We will support you through the legal process. Don't talk to the police, especially without legal representation or support. Don’t share pictures of protestors with identifying information (including visible faces).The Portland General Defense Committee (https://pdxgdc.com/) has provided ongoing legal support to workers and protesters in Oregon since 2017, relying on over a century of national experience. The GDC works in connection with the National Lawyers Guild and other Portland-based organizations.The legal process can take a tremendous amount of time. Most cases take 6 months to a year to be resolved and some cases can take up to two years.   For this reason,  disbursements and reporting will be ongoing possibly up to two years from now depending on people’s charges and cases. We will be continually updating information regarding these expenditures as money is used to bail people out and support peoples’ legal cases. These reports will be available through GoFundMe updates and our website. Because we have access to limited funds, our first focus is freeing vulnerable protestors (including those at high risk of contracting COVID-19 while incarcerated, members of marginalized communities (especially BIPOC protestors), and those without stable housing. Initially, the GDC set a fundraising goal of $5,000. As the number of reported arrests rise and the severity of the charges have increased, we have raised that goal to meet increased demand. Funds raised through the GDC will be distributed directly to protestors facing legal action as any financial needs come up. The funds will be used to pay for bail, legal fees and fines, lawyers, discovery, investigations, personal material support and any other financial needs that arise during the legal process. Funds raised in excess of local needs will be directed to Black-led organizations working in Portland and bail funds supporting protestors in other US cities. The legal process for these protestors is only starting: we’re seeing arraignment dates set months out. Arraignment typically occurs in a matter of days and this extended schedule will increase the expense, stress, and other harm protestors face. In addition to financial support, we’ll be asking for community members to attend hearings and participate in the defense of our comrades. Subscribe on Twitter (https://twitter.com/pdxgdc) or Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/pdxiwwgdc/) to receive updates as the legal process proceeds.Amelia Cates and Thursday Bram are members of the Local Secretary Treasurer working group of the GDC. This group maintains the accounting documents and bank account along with other members of the LST working group.  Members of the media may request further information by email at [email redacted].*** Please note that this fundraiser supports protestors arrested before Election Day.

#BlackLivesMatter #WeDoHealIn the wake of George Floyd's murder is a long, painful month that’s an extension of a year that’s challenged us to our core.We need healing. We need justice. And that requires action.Systemic change requires prolonged effort, but we can also make an immediate difference for frontline communities. The Black Resilience Fund was launched on June 1st, 2020 to foster healing and resilience by providing immediate financial relief to Black Portlanders. Over $700,000 has been distributed to Black Portlanders since our launch, and we've also established a mutual aid network of over 300 active volunteers, delivering food boxes, performing yard work, providing emotional support, and more.The Black Resilience Fund is co-founded by Cameron Whitten and Salomé Chimuku. Cameron is a local Portlander who has more than 5 years of experience in nonprofit leadership and donation accountability. Cameron has served as the Executive Director of local nonprofits such as Know Your City, Brown Hope, and Q Center. Salomé has over a decade of experience in public sector work, working with organizations such as Portland State University, the Urban League of Portland, and Unite Oregon. She has served on many local social justice and advocacy boards and has worked for many statewide elected officials in the Oregon Legislature. We’re proud of everything the BRF team has accomplished with 100% volunteer energy. Through passion, grit, and collaboration, we’ve established a solid infrastructure that can benefit our entire community over the long term. In order to make this lasting impact, we know we’ll need stable leadership that we can’t attain with volunteer time alone. Thus, we will begin encouraging folks to donate to Brown Hope, the nonprofit that is sponsoring the Black Resilience Fund. A portion of all new donations made to Brown Hope for the BRF will be dedicated to the Black Resilient Futures Fund, with a goal of bringing paid staff to help sustain the work. We will continue to keep our GoFundMe campaign live as it’s linked to several newspaper articles and websites, and is a great way to communicate with the 13,000 people who have donated so far. You can make a tax-deductible donation to the Black Resilience Fund through Brown Hope, here: https://secure.givelively.org/donate/brown-hope/black-resilience-fundYou can also donate via check: write a check to BROWN HOPE and mail to 2037 N Williams Ave, Portland, OR 97227.

As we grant to new organizations, we will include them below.:- The Bail Project - The NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund - Center for Policing Equity - RAHEEM - Equal Justice Initiative - Advancement Project These organizations were chosen for the leadership they’ve demonstrated and the meaningful impact they have had on the causes that the Justice + Equality Fund will initially benefit. This is just the first step. We’ll keep donors updated as we expand the reach of the Fund by adding additional individuals, organizations, and benefiting causes.Racial inequality and injustice have no place in our society.

Our EIN is 85-1376745.]Introducing House of Tulip .House of Tulip is a Community Land Trust launching in the summer of 2020 to create housing solutions for trans and gender-nonconforming (TGNC) people in Louisiana.1 in 3 trans people in Louisiana report experiencing homelessness at some point in their life.* With your help, we will break that cycle for good in the New Orleans area.Who We Are:Our Founders Circle is a multicultural and multigenerational leadership body of 11 individuals in the New Orleans area. We are majority-Black and majority-women, and a majority of us have our family roots in Louisiana for several generations. Together, we have over 100 years of experience as community organizers and activists serving the transgender community in Louisiana. We are Milan Nicole Sherry, Mariah Moore, Jai Celestial, Sultana Isham, Camilla Marchena, Dylan Waguespack, Ben Collongues, Wendi Cooper, Toni Jones, Zahair Martinez, and Spirit McIntyre. Our Short-Term Vision:We’re raising funds to buy and restore a 6-unit property on N. Claiborne Ave, currently unoccupied and blighted. This will be our pilot campus, and it will house up to 9 TGNC people. If for any reason, we're unable to purchase this property (if it's sold or taken off the market before we raise the funds we need), the funds raised by this campaign will still go directly toward providing housing to TGNC people in New Orleans, in line with the long-term vision below. Our Long-Term Vision: Housing Solutions.According to the US Trans Survey, 1 in 3 trans people in Louisiana reports experiencing homelessness at some point in their lives. House of Tulip will provide zero-barrier housing to trans and gender-nonconforming people in need of a safe place to stay while growing the supply of affordable housing in New Orleans. Citywide Benefits.By operating as a Community Land Trust, the entire city of New Orleans (as well as anywhere we expand beyond our pilot campus) will benefit from the increase in affordable housing supply and safeguards against exclusionary development and gentrification. Paths to Home-Ownership.House of Tulip isn’t an emergency shelter or a transitional living house. It’s a long-term investment in housing solutions. As members of our community gain stability through housing, they’ll have a path to homeownership. Meanwhile, House of Tulip will continue to own the land, ensuring our housing stays affordable forever.Self-Sustaining.While initially our funding will be entirely donation-based, our model will grow to include sustainable sources of income so that we can invest strategically.We have $50,000 in seed funding--12.5 percent of the way to our goal--but we need your investment to get to $400,000 by August 31, 2020.If you'd prefer to write a check, please make it out to ""House of Tulip"" and mail it to our treasurer:Dylan Waguespack1203 Trinidad Ave NEWashington, DC 20002If you would like to give monthly, you can become a sustaining donor on our website at https://houseoftulip.org/make-a-donation. Becoming a sustaining donor helps us budget wisely knowing how much money will be coming in.

Memphis faces a serious lack of emergency housing: In 2016, there were only 71 beds available in emergency shelters across the metro area—and none of them were designated as trans-specific. Many of them actively discriminate against transgender people.Our Executive Director, Kayla Gore, and board member Ellyahnna C. Wattshall created My Sistah’s House in response to a crisis they were witnessing among their own community members. Executive Director, Kayla Gore, converted a six-bedroom house she owns, into an emergency housing facility with eight beds available for TLGBQ people in need of shelter. My Sistah’s House primarily serves TGNC people of color, many of whom have recently been released from incarceration, are experiencing intimate partner violence, and/or are experiencing homelessness or housing insecurity.Expanding on our emergency housing program, our volunteer staff set up a bail fund for incarcerated trans women in the area, and began offering our clients advocacy, legal and multi-level resource assistance to help them secure permanent housing and stable income. Within the last year alone, with limited resources and an all-volunteer staff, My Sistah’s House has provided emergency housing to 35 TLGBQ individuals, successfully transitioning them into permanent housing. We have also provided multipronged resource assistants to100 individuals, allowing some of our communities most vulnerable to become more self-sufficient and secure.My Sistah’s House works in partnership with our fiscal sponsor, The Knights and Orchids Society My Sistah's House is asking during such a Fragile time in our Country, where Black Trans Communities are continuing to Stand in Solidarity with ALL Black BODIES and our Country. We need your help to continue standing, we need to ensure we have the tools and resources needed to take care of our Community while we Stand Together.

Brandon is a Senior in Edison High School - Edison, NJ, graduating this year. His dad passed away when he was only 5. Tragically, his mom also passed away this year. He has two brothers that he cares for daily. His fear is that once he graduates, they will lose their home and have nowhere to go. There is $125,000 left on the mortgage. As a family friend, I have organized this fundraiser for Brandon and his brothers because this financial burden seems like a huge mountain for an 18 year old to move. But if everyone can find it in their heart to donate what they can, maybe we can put a dent in that number or even erase it. As a community, we've all experienced so much sadness and heartbreak since the declaration of the pandemic. Let's try to do something positive, uplifting and life-changing that could shift the course of these boys' lives forever.I have set the fundraising goat at $150,000. Funds will be distributed to the bank to pay off the $125,000 mortgage. Proof of payments will be posted on this page. The additional $25,000 will help ease the burden of living expenses, property taxes, as well as covering costs associated with Brandon's education at Middlesex County Community College where he plans to pursue a career in Law Enforcement.Think of the joy it would provide for them if we could help pay off that mortgage and provide a forever home for them. Not only will it easy the financial burden, but also enable the boys to focus on their education.

We, along with countless other MN small businesses, have suffered long enough. Our customers, friends and family have been so supportive; the love shown to us over these past eight weeks with donations, gift cards and take out orders has been tremendous! We thank all of you for that from the bottom of our hearts. We love you all! With that being said, we unfortunately can't survive on just take out orders. We need our business back just like so many others do. This isn't a fight we should HAVE to fight, but it is a fight we are GOING to fight! We are taking a stand to fight for our rights to earn a living, to fight for our employees and their families and to fight for ALL MN SMALL BUSINESSES! In order to do this, we need to raise a minimum of $100,000 for legal fees to bring this to the Supreme Court. We want to ensure that this never, ever happens to any of us again.

It’s time we acknowledge our essential workers on the field and in the farms. As they supply our food every day and go unnoticed in the dark smoke. The conditions these workers are in are unacceptable considering the pandemic the heat and now the fire smoke. But regardless of the conditions they show up every day for us. So it’s time to show up for them. When we went out there to ask them what we could help with their first response was they needed basic school supplies for their children. We were shook by this response, how is it that our essential workers don’t have enough money for basic educational supplies as we enter a school year of distance learning. These farm workers are more concerned about the school year coming up as they can’t be there for there children because they are at work feeding the nation. But for people that care so much about others, who is going to care about them? WE ARE. If this system doesn’t care, WE DO.  And if we have to stand as a community to make a difference where it counts, WE WILL. You see even if these farm workers prefer the funds go to their childrens education, we still need these workers to be protected. We need to protect our farm field workers. We have gotten news that some of these employers are not supplying their workers with protective working equipment as they continue working in this hazardous smoke from the nearby fires. More than ever we need to stand up for those serving our community. Migrant workers should receive higher wages and better working conditions as they are essential. This fundraiser was created by Flor Martinez, animmigrant rights activists who herself worked asa farm worker before she qualified for DACA. 

Flor has multiple contacts in the agricultural community and is able to direct these funds directly to farm supervisors by transportation vehicles to the farm sites and have distribution by volunteers. 

These funds along with the additional Venmo funds will divided in half between the farm workers protection and the farm workers children school supplies.  

Funds will be withdrawn into the non-profit The Celebration Foundation, where all masks and school supplies are bought electronically with clear transaction receipts posted on the website coming soon. 

The people benefiting from this fundraiser is farmworkers and farm workers children, Flor is able to distribute supplies directly to her wide set of contacts who trust her enough to show up to these farms and fields.

WE NEED TO SAVE THE UNCLES!

Uncle Hugo's is one of the shining landmarks of science fiction & fantasy literature. It is part bookstore and part archival museum for written science fiction and fantasy books. It is located with its fellow Uncle (Uncle Edgar devoted to mystery) all under one roof in Minneapolis.

Its owner Don Blyly started it in 1974 and has become renown for its selection of rare and hard to find books in pop culture. 



New books help to keep the store running and their stock might be the most comprehensive found anywhere, including a wide selection of used books. Whilemany of the used books are purchased by budget conscious readers, the store’s used books are also a Mecca for rare and out-of-print editions sought by collectors. Curating and maintaining such a wide variety is no easy feat, but Blyly has a knowledgeable staff that he respects as professionals.Last night during the latest unrest and protests that have gripped Minneapolis,Uncle Hugo's was burned down. 

Don Blyly has spent his life building Uncle Hugo's into a treasure for readers, creators, and the community. It is our understanding that the building and most of the stock is a complete loss.

As members of the community I am asking for anyone that can to help in what ever way they can, money for a new location, donations of books, and hard to find items, you name it,

 

Let us rebuild our monument to our passion both for a man that has given so much to the community over the years and our community.

With the loss of Takehiko’s job their health insurance costs will increase substantially.  After having worked at the Lahey Clinic Medical Center in Massachusetts for four years, Takehiko took a position at the Penn State Health Milton S. Hershey Medical Center and moved to Pennsylvania in 2017.  He lived alone for three years while his wife and son remained in Lexington, Massachusetts for his son to finish high school, only being able to see them occasionally.  He and his wife had finally reunited just a month ago and settled in Hershey, Pennsylvania. Tora entered New York University this fall to pursue a career in medicine, following in his father’s and grandfather’s footsteps.  Takehiko was a bright, hardworking, and friendly person.  He was a kind and loving husband to Noriko, as well as an amazing father to their son Tora.  Takehiko often talked happily about his plans to remodel the basement of their new house.  Originally from Kyoto, Japan, Takehiko graduated from Osaka Medical School in 1989 and finished his residency at the Toranomon Hospital in Japan.  Takehiko moved to the US in 2001 to start his career as a physician and researcher. He had worked at Yale University, University of Massachusetts Medical School, and the Wistar Institute at Penn and completed transplant surgery fellowship at the Jackson Memorial Hospital in Florida. We would greatly appreciate it if you would consider making a donation in any amount to support Noriko and Tora.   Thank you very much for your support. This fundraiser was organized by the Japanese community, affiliates of Japanese Language School of Greater Boston, and friends in Lexington, Massachusetts on behalf of Noriko and Tora Dohi.

These individuals are not receiving the critical social and mental health services they so desperately require. This lack of planning is a disservice to these individuals and the community. We have repeatedly reached out to our local officials for help, and have either received no response or condescending platitudes. Oftentimes, they have made personal attacks on our character.  Our voices have been ignored. Now is the time for action.  That’s why neighbors and friends have come together to form the West Side Community Organization.  We are an unpaid, volunteer, non-partisan grassroots organization who met virtually through the recently formed Facebook group, Upper West Siders for Safer Streets , which has grown to a community of nearly 10,000 concerned members.  We are committed to preserving the qualities that make the Upper West Side a great place to live, work, raise a family and enjoy retirement.  We refuse to accept that nothing can be done to solve these issues.  We must protect our children, while at the same time demand that the city provide real services to these struggling individuals.  The current situation is not only unacceptable, it is inhumane. The West Side Community Organization is a 501(c)4 not-for-profit social welfare organization. Donations are not tax-deductible. Your donation will help support our efforts to make our neighborhood safe again and restore our quality of life.  100% of all donations will go toward the retaining of professionals in the fields of communications, government relations and law.  Please learn more about our organization at www.westsideco.org .   Additional information will be coming soon on how to become more involved.* Please note that GoFundMe has an optional fee when you donate. You may choose to make that amount 0%.

We (the KCPD) advised he's well cared for, but if she wanted to donate for restaurant or gas station gift cards for his family so they can eat at and travel to/from the hospital, we were accepting those at East Patrol Division. She went on to say she lives in the urban core of Kansas City, and her daughter was murdered in 2012. She said the detectives who worked her daughter's case were like her therapists, fathers, and lifelines all in one.She said she lost her job a month ago and has been struggling to pay her bills. She went to the grocery store last week and found a $1 bill in the parking lot. She used that to buy a lottery ticket, with which she won $100. Her 12-year-old daughter was with her and said, ""Mom, we should give that to the police officer who got shot."" She agreed immediately. With her current financial hardship, we urged her to keep the money. She refused, saying the officer's family needed it, and police needed to know they were supported.We at KCPD shared this wonderful act of humanity on our social media. Then hundreds of people said they wanted to help her out. However, the woman had called from an unlisted number and didn't leave a name. It took a while, but we were able to track her down. Her name is Shetara Sims. She is on the left of this photo (along with KCPD social worker Brooke and Officer Earle). She's a struggling single mom. Even when we found her again, she asked, ""Don't the officer and his family need it more?"" Shetara's act of kindness has touched Kansas City, and they wanted to give back.

That family extends beyond the membership to our staff and their families.  Many of our staff are well known and many behind the scenes, but they share the common charge to make The River a memorable place.Due to the complexity and vagaries of the Cares Act, some of our staff are unfortunately unable to fully replace their incomes.  We are not alone in this dilemma.  Several peer clubs established initiatives to provide financial assistance to their at-risk staff. In response, we formed a team and approached the Board of Governors with the idea of establishing an effort to support our at-risk staff.  The Board is fully supportive of this member-led effort and we established The CRCC Covid-19 Staff Relief Fund GoFundMe Campaign. Our goal is to exceed $100,000 in donations for the relief fund to help our at-risk staff and we have commitments of $10,000 at the outset of the campaign.The campaign entirely voluntary and hopefully well over-subscribed as are all River events.  We are not a 501c3 so donations are not tax deductible.  However, helping those less fortunate than us is more important than tax deductible receipt.Let’s rise to the occasion and support our staff.The River Runs Strong!Thanks for your support!  The CRCC Covid-19 Staff Relief Fundraising CommitteeLewis Frazer                  Hillary McNeillDave McClellan           Bob MahoneyJohn Marino                  Bill Supple

While this was appropriate in the early years, we now have thousands of program participants attending courses each year in a makeshift campground scenario with an outdoor kitchen, porta potties, canvas tents, and bucket showers. The drinking water well, septic system, and family home are groaning under the impact of this excessive use. Our County Health Department recently notified us that we are no longer operating as a residential site and need to comply with commercial facility guidelines. We need to comply or cease operations. In order to keep offering our farmer training and food sovereignty programming, Soul Fire Farm is building a Program Center, Guest Lodge, Classroom , and Commercial Drinking Water and Wastewater Systems. All buildings will be energy efficient, accessible, fire-safe, environmentally sustainable, and bring us up to code.  Participants in Soul Fire Farm’s Builders Immersions will have the opportunity to learn hands-on building skills during the construction, including basic carpentry, straw bale panel construction, and natural plasters. Once the buildings are finished, we will no longer be confined to the short tent camping season for our overnight programs and will be able to offer spring and fall courses. This will help with our multi-year waiting list by more than doubling the number of people who can attend farmer training. We invite you to join us in Fortifying Our Foundation at Soul Fire Farm! These campus improvements are quite literally essential for the continued food sovereignty work of the organization. It's about investment in the long term future of the farm and our community. ***Soul Fire Farm is an Afro-Indigenous centered training farm committed to ending racism and seeding sovereignty in the food system. Our food sovereignty programs reach over 10,000 people each year, including farmer training for Black and Brown growers, reparations and land return initiatives for northeast farmers, food justice workshops for urban youth, home gardens for city-dwellers living under food apartheid, doorstep harvest delivery for food insecure households, and systems and policy education for public decision-makers.

Now the farming season is starting and the window to purchase CSA’s is coming to a close. CSA farm shares are finite, and there are only so many we can buy no matter how much we raise. So what’s next!?Visioning a sustainable, food secure future for our people, we are looking for ways to cultivate food ourselves. A future where Black and brown people in Vermont can come together to live, heal and thrive. Which to us, means purchasing land for farming, gardening and intergenerational healing. A space that is stewarded by Black and brown people, a place of safety, connection, and healing.Our vision is to build healing and nourishing spaces for our people and our children in the here and now but our vision is long-range as we look to the future. A future where food sovereignty is guaranteed to the next generations of Black and brown people in Vermont.We have been looking at Soul Fire Farm and Freedom Farm as a model for what we envision creating here in brattleboro. A place to connect our children and our people back to the land, a place to heal and reclaim our stories and the wisdom our ancestors left for us. A place to build black futures right here in our own community and create safety.Help us realize this dream by donating to our fund.We are in the very beginning stages of a long term vision which will require learning about land trusts and ways for us to secure land for the future.Love us alive, don’t idolize us when we die. Protecting black futures and people means creating spaces for us to THRIVE while we are alive not waiting for us to die.The SUSU Healing Collective is a BIPOC led collective in Brattleboro, VT. We are raising funds to purchase land that will be a safe place for BIPOC in VT and will include educational programming, land access, farming, CSA's and food access, restorative justice, school programs and more (all future visions). Right now our hope is to raise $50,000 towards the cost of land to pay for land. $14,000 of the money raised so far is going to the previous project which was to purchase 22 CSA's for POC's in Brattleboro Vermont. susuheals.com****Our people are dying.Black and brown people are dying.We need healing.We need commUNITY.We need safety.We deserve nourishment.We deserve joy.We deserve connection.We are reaching out to our community for support, we need you now more than ever. We have experienced love and support during this time and questions of how you can help us. This is what we need:We hope to raise $12,000 to fund 20 local Brattleboro POC (people of color) CSA's for this year. These times are traumatizing, on top of a global pandemic our POC communities are being hit the hardest, we are watching our people be lynched and murdered in cold blood. We are dealing with the emotional, mental, physical, and spiritual pain of witnessing this and living and operating everyday in a white supremacist culture.On top of all of this trauma we want to make sure that our people have opportunities to experience nourishment, that they have the chance to connect to the earth for healing, that they can have access to healthy , life giving, and nourishing food and that this will be one less thing they have to worry about.Over the next few months we will be launching a  few more gofund me's, the next one will be for funds that can be used  for 20 Brattleboro POC's to take a workshop, class, or healing sessions that they choose that will contribute to their healing and connection, the following gofund me will be to raise money for the SUSU so we can provide free healing sessions and herbs to our people. Will you join us in healing our people starting right here in Brattleboro?With government relief packages and funding one thing that has become more apparent to us is the lack of trust our country has with POC led organizations and people, funding is generally funneled into white led orgs, covering admin budgets and salaries and then very little trickles down and gets to the people who need it. Leaving many of our people under the radar and with lack of access to life giving foods and opportunities for healing (the healing that is culturally relevant and needed for us).We are asking you to trust us.We are asking you to trust POC led organizations and people.We are asking you to trust that we know what we need and that we don't need white orgs. to tell us what we need and what healing looks like to us.We are asking you to direct fund/support POC's in our community and POC led organizations in our community.Thank you so much for your support. This is how we build commUNITY, this is how we build cultures of reciprocity and healing, this is how we build black futures, this is how we care for our people.Every penny, every share on social media, every mention to your friends, every share on IG makes a huge difference.Thank you Brattleboro, we know together we can do this!With love and divine blackness,The SUSU Healing Collectivesusuheals.com

For those of you who don't know me, my name is Jessica (Hollie) Orta, but I am known by Bella Eiko for live streaming the Occupy Oakland and Ferguson movements. Over the last few years I have spoken out about my relationship, and marriage, to Ramsey prior to his incarceration. Ramsey physically, mentally, emotionally abused and financially extorted my son and I as I tried to position myself to organize support for him during his incarceration. After I drove to Las Vegas to avoid any further attacks from him, he used the money given to him by the movement to chase me down to Las Vegas and terrorize myself, my son and my then 82 year old Great Aunt. He often threatened me with gang violence and gave my address to people who wanted to harm me as punishment for not staying to endure more of his abuses while supporting him as he negotiated a lesser prison sentence. In one of our altercations Ramsey physically attacked me by choking me and kidnapping my son for ransom money. You can imagine my shock because of him filming Eric Garner being murdered in the same way. The night before that attack, Ramsey verbally harassed me for not being able to hold in my urination after driving around for over half an hour looking for parking and then walking blocks trying to reach the apartment on Baruch in record breaking cold. These are only a few of the situations I have dealt with during our marriage. I am asking that the movement that has been supporting Ramsey Orta to hold him, and those who knowingly shielded him from any repercussions for his actions, accountable for his domestic actions towards Black Women. I would also like to be able to go through a divorce process without him abruptly being able to stop it. In November of 2019, he backed away from the divorce proceedings, having his attorney tell me that he would be in touch, after I responded that I would want his assistance for long term therapy for my son and I after being exposed to his violence. Help in this area is greatly appreciated as it is more expensive than I can afford as a single mother. I also would like the movements, Black Lives Matter, Occupy Oakland, Hands Up Don't Shoot & I Can't Breathe, to take action in keeping my son and I safe. I have had to move away from the city far from my friends and family because I feel I am in danger if I were ever to return, especially with him now having access to his welcome home fund, coupled with the blind support of many Black Lives Matter supporters. I have been an organizer and given my life to this movement as a Black Woman, and this movement has only stood against me in support of Ramsey Orta. I am asking that this movement consider how it will move forward if it continues to silence Black Women  and overlook the bad action of their heroes. The plausible alternatives for police in handling these kinds of situations moving forward are conversations that I’ve been trying to have for years.I am not asking for police involvement. If I wanted to handle this with the police, I would have pressed charges on Ramsey but I am adamantly against the continuation of the prison industrial complex. I strongly believe in police abolition but we cannot continue to build a movement in which black women and black children continue to be targets of misogyny in their households. You cannot continue to praise someone for a single action, when they've attacked and perpetrated violence towards the most vulnerable people in your community. In order to talk about police abolition we must also talk about the future we wish to replace it with. We will not be able to accomplish that safe future if we don't hold accountable the actions of individuals that resemble those of the same patriarchal system. With love & All Power to the People, Bella Eiko

Kirk leaves behind his wife Julie and his two beautiful children Karsen and Kash.  The Leavells are the owners of Wild Basin Fitness at the front of Steiner Ranch. Like many small companies, the pandemic has significantly impacted their business as we all hope to return to normal.  My name is Paul Shaffer and I am a local resident of Steiner Ranch who trained under Kirk for the past 11 years.  Many people had reached out to me asking how they could help the family.  This site is being set up to help Julie and the kids with any short term needs with funeral expenses and other financial burdens that they will encounter in the coming months as well as to help defray college costs for the children.  I have Julie's approval to take the funds that are raised and add to an account that some of her closest friends have set up for her at SouthStar Bank.  In addition to this, we will be setting up a 529 Plan in Karsen's and Kash's name to help ease the financial burden for college. Any amount is deeply appreciated to help this family in need.

Please check out our website www.oaklandblackbusinessfund.org for more information, to apply for funding for your business or to sign up to our volunteer database*(Originally posted 6/1/2020)“A riot is the voice of the unheard” - MLKFriends, On May 29,2020 in Oakland,many took to the streets in rage and sorrow to protest the killing of black people by police in America . While we are tired, many of us also hear the calls to action of this moment and want to do what we can to address the injustice experienced by George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and so many more. As we navigate this time, I encourage everyone to VALUE LIVES FIRST - please prioritize donating to bail out funds, legal defense funds, social justice funds and other organizations continuing the daily fight to end structural racism rooted in white supremacy. A list of priority organizations to donate to is provided below.If you are able to do more, there are other steps we can take to support the long-term economic viability of the black community in our city.  While the majority of black-owned businesses were unharmed during the most recent protests, a few received superficial damages to their store fronts, including broken glass and graffiti. Our black business community is already suffering financially as a result of COVID-19 closures and they run the risk of long-term hardships or permanent closure.  Repair costs can be significant— as a point of reference, it costs about $1,400 to replace a single piece of plate glass and insurance deductibles are often even more expensive for business owners. With this in mind, we know that small amounts will go a long way for our vital small businesses during this time. As always, I believe in the resiliency of the black community here, both in the face of racist tyranny and economic uncertainty, however it is up to us to support our own. Please join me in raising funds to be used as small grants of between $100 - $500 (depending on how much is raised) to help reimburse expenses  incurred by Black-owned businesses to repair damage caused by protests. The plan is for funds to be distributed as shown below starting June 1, 2020.“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.It is our duty to win.We must love each other and support each other.We have nothing to lose but our chains.”Assata ShakurWith Love,Elisse *If you are interested in co-sponsoring this fundraising effort, helping to distribute funds and/or helping with business outreach etc. please let me know.Reimbursable costsGlass repair and replacementGraffiti abatement (ex. cleaning supplies, painting supplies, graffiti coating replacement)Facade and sidewalk cleaning  (ex. cleaning supplies, painting supplies, graffiti coating replacement costs, trash removal)Who is EligibleGround floor black owned businesses in Oakland damaged during the May 28-31st protestsHow the Funds will be DisbursedA Google forms application will be distributed via social media and other organizations in Oakland that support black businesses.

Donate today to ensure they can keep their home. As a 10-year-old, Levi was struck with a rare form of cancer… and now a single mother of two is fighting for his health, his childhood, and their family home. Due to unfortunate circumstances, Levi, his brother Colt, and their Mother Tami are on the verge of losing their family home in Stamping Ground, Kentucky - the very home that had just been equipped specifically for Levi and his ongoing surgeries. After learning of their story, Doorways of Hope, a 501(c)3 Non-profit has committed to giving 100% of proceeds raised in this campaign to the family to ensure they can keep their family home.  WHAT YOUR DONATION WILL DOCurrently, Tami and the kids are on the verge of losing their home and need to prove they can afford the home by the middle of November 2020.  100% of donations received will go directly toward paying off the mortgage, ensuring Tami and the kids can stay in their home and give Levi (and Colt) a safe, secure place to grow up in. TEAM LEVI BACKGROUNDTwo years ago Levi Delimpo was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer, Ewing Carcoma, and was only given a 15% chance of survival. During that time, a group of people around the country and their local community rallied around their family in an unbelievable way and Team Levi was born!

Although this would be a huge win, they would still be financially burdened and within the year they would need to look for additional resources. Fundraising Milestone #2 - $150,000  At this amount, Tami and the boys would be able to keep the home and have a 3-4 year runway, ensuring they could stay in the home and let the boys grow up there through their formative years. Fundraising Milestone #3- $300,000At this amount, the home would be purchased in-full and owned outright by Tami Delimpo. This would ensure the family never has to worry about the future; Tami could focus fully on raising her two boys in their home, keeping Levi healthy, and allow both boys to be raised there. About the Organizer, Doorways of Hope - 501(c)3 Non-ProfitDoorways of Hope is a 501(c)3 Non-Profit aimed at providing rest, restoration, and hope to families who have undergone trauma or a major life disturbance.

The business closed its doors in March due to COVID-19. Without your financial support, Aunt Charlie's will not survive and will close for good on August 1st.Your donations can SAVE AUNT CHARLIE’S so it can continue to serve its unique community. We are calling upon YOU to raise funds during this difficult time until it can re-open and thrive. Invest in our community space: to keep the drag queens lip-syncing, bartenders SERVING, the dancers dancing all night, and YOU living your authentic life in a REAL atmosphere. After the SIP Order, the bar’s owner,  William Erkelens, applied for a PPP loan and received only a fraction of the requested funds because the business is just “too small.” Erkelens has been paying rent and utilities out of his own pocket. All money raised will go towards direct business expenses: rent, utilities, and operations. Any funds received beyond our goal will be invested in the long-term sustainability of your favorite community gathering place. Here’s a little Aunt Charlie’s history: the Lounge opened in 1987 near the corner of Turk & Taylor when the Tenderloin neighborhood was bustling with gay nightlife. Aunt Charlie’s is known for Sunday fundraisers and weekly drag and disco parties: Hot Boxxx Girls, Tubesteak Connection, and Angels (formerly High Fantasy and Chasers). In 2014, the block where Aunt Charlie’s is located was renamed to honor Vicki Marlane, a beloved performer and bar regular. Aunt Charlie’s remains an important intergenerational working class queer space that supports the neighborhood’s senior population. It is one of the few LGBTQ+ spaces open 365 days a year. Saving Aunt Charlie’s will ensure that our community will continue to have a place to safely gather.At a moment when historical queer spaces are closing, reach into your pockets to Save Aunt Charlie’s!

It ended by affirming support of the Black Lives Matter movement and calling for allies to ""break the cycle of trauma created by racism and violence.""The next week, members of the Barron County Board of Supervisors executive committee went into closed session to discuss the county's relationship with Embrace. After gaveling back into open session, the board voted to stop funding the organization by cutting $25,000 slated to go to the advocacy group next year. Supervisors also voted to have the county's director of Health and Human Services resign from Embrace's board of directors. County HHS director Stacey Frolik didn't discuss what happened during the closed session, but told WPR the dispute between the county and Embrace started when ""there was some outward facing support for Black Lives Matter."" She said before the Embrace statement went public it was presented to the group's board of directors, of which she was a member at the time. She said she and other board members indicated that the statement shouldn't have been released.""And from a departmental standpoint, I was not feeling comfortable continuing on as a board member of Embrace, just knowing kind of the stance that they were taking with, you know, with law enforcement,"" said Frolik. ""That made me very uncomfortable personally and professionally.""Frolik said Embrace has been serving as the county's domestic violence and sexual assault advocate for just over a year. Before that, she said the county had one employee who focused on those services. As a result, Frolik said the county didn't have the ""depth of services"" that it currently does.She said the $25,000 that would have gone to Embrace is still in the county's budget for domestic abuse services. The county still refers domestic abuse survivors to Embrace, but Frolik said that funding could possibly be used on direct assistance for survivors if the relationship between Embrace and the county deteriorates further.Barron County Sheriff Chris Fitzgerald had already resigned from the Embrace board prior to the statement issued at the end of September, in part because of signs posted by Embrace supporting the Black Lives Matter movement, which he said advocates for defunding police departments. Fitzgerald said the group's support could alienate some victims of domestic violence or sexual assault, particularly those with ""law enforcement relationships.""""We were some big supporters of Embrace and we felt that they were not supporting law enforcement and taking the side of some of the anti-law enforcement out there,"" said Fitzgerald.Fitzgerald said while the relationship has been cut, his department will still refer victims of domestic violence and sexual assault to Embrace for services. Embrace Executive Director Katie Bement said Barron County's decision to cut the $25,000 in future support caught them by surprise. She said the organization's support of the Black Lives Matter movement is not a criticism of local law enforcement agencies.  ""We really have this understanding that racism, police violence, sexual violence and domestic violence all have the same root causes and they interact and compound on each other, both in society and the survivors we serve,"" said Bement. ""So, we feel we can't remain silent and neutral in the face of violence and oppression, or we're doing harm.""She said none of the survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault they work with have complained about the statement or support of Black lives Matter. Bement said local police and Embrace should be able to disagree without defunding services that survivors of violence depend on. Dave Willingham is the chair of Embrace's board of directors. He said the statement issued at the end of September was reviewed by board members and while some ""expressed more misgivings about some of the language than others,"" no members said it shouldn't be released. Willingham said the idea that Embrace's support of Black Lives Matter is akin to calling for local law enforcement agencies to be defunded isn't accurate. ""And so it seemed ironic to me that somebody would object to the words 'Black Lives Matter' on the basis that it represents defund the police, and then turn around and advocate for defunding Embrace,"" said Willingham. Bement and Willingham said they're hoping to meet with the Barron County Board of Supervisors Executive Committee to explain their statement and advocate for the return of their 2021 funding. Embrace isn't the first victims advocacy organization to support anti-racism efforts and the Black Lives Matter Movement. In July, The Wisconsin Coalition Against Sexual Assault and End Domestic Abuse Wisconsin issued a joint letter titled ""Moment of Truth."" It said the coronavirus pandemic, increased police violence and political and economic upheaval produced the ""perfect storm"" that advocacy organizations have to face. ""We have spent decades building our movement’s voice and power,"" said the letter. ""How we use them now will define us in the years ahead. Let our actions show that we did not stand idly by. Let them show that we learned, changed, and will continue to demonstrate that Black Lives Matter is a centering practice for our work.”Embrace's full anti-racism statement can be found here: www.embracewi.org/antiracism-statementOur Mission and Vision:To end violence, inspire hope and provide unwavering support to all people affected by domestic and sexual violence by engaging our community in safety, equality and partnership.Embrace envisions a courageous social change taking place ending all forms of oppression and violence and creating healthy communities where every person has the support to thrive."

It’s peak season, and we’re currently at 16 requests that we don’t have the funds to fulfill - with more coming in by the minute. Any donations will be a huge help to get folks in the area outside while the weather is good! ***UPDATE***We will no longer be offering REI products as part of our kits and we are temporarily pausing kit requests (we made it to 600!!!) Please see our update for more information.The default camping kits include a two-person tent andtand sleeping bags. At full price, each kit costs roughly $250. On sale, they’re $180~ or so. This doesn’t include requests that involve getting specific gear such as a larger tent & cooler for families or smaller backpacks for children & babies. Help us break down the financial barriers that camping brings to the table! Donations go towards the cost of the Camp Kits and additional gear requested plus the cost of shipping items out that cannot be dropped off locally. The way we do things is by buying the kits from retailers depending on additional requests like baby carriers and other outdoor gear for little ones) and then either shipping directly from the retailer to the kit requestee, or shipping and delivering the kits to the recipients ourselves depending on what's going in to the kit and where the recipient lives. If you're in our local area, we can take the kit to you as soon as it arrives! If not then shipping is just fine. We can also ship to Canada! If you’re a white person that has enjoyed the privilege of access to the outdoors (hello pnw!), this is one of many ways to give back & donate! Donations can be $$$ and/or info on good (not crowded, peaceful) camping & hiking in the pnw. Campsite/trail names, any accessibility info, how much it costs, and whether a Discovery Pass is needed. You can also help in the form of donating unused gear, hmu at [email redacted] if you’re interested. ~~~ ***UPDATE***We reached 600 kit requests within two weeks! Because of this huge demand we will be temporarily closing down requests until we are able to fulfill the current ones.

We’re getting together some basic camping kits for anyone in need. The kits include one 2-person tent, two adult-sized sleeping bags, and a cooler! As BIPOC, we’re far less likely to have access to the beauty of our national parks, camping sites, and hikes. Access that is vital for those in need of the freedom, healing, peace, and fun  that comes with it. For folks in the Tacoma area, we can do local kit drop-offs and give a (socially distant~) demo on tent set up and break down for anyone who wants/needs it. For everyone else we can ship the kits to you and I can offer help over ft or ig if you have questions or need a demo. To get a kit, there’s no need to demonstrate or present anything special, just hmu at [email redacted] or littleuzipervert on ig and we’ll make it work.

The law firm hired is Harris Beach.  We will be represented by Jack Martins.  There is no process without Due process. The government entity cannot circumvent laws and procedures without repercussions. We urge you to please join us and raise money to support our efforts to force local officials to STOP this facility from opening in order to help preserve the safety and well being of our families and neighborhood.  This money will be strictly used for all legal services necessary to fight this.  At this time there is no plan or approved decision on how any extra funds will be used.  We will update you when and if that decision will be made.

Our land is just 6 minutes from the Oconee River and Balls Ferry National Park. We were able to purchase our land utilizing cooperative economics. Together 19 relatives and close friends will begin a new development for our elders to retire, our families to enjoy vacation homes, and to create a thriving safe haven for BIPOC all over. We hope to create a space for our family and yours to enjoy family reunions, weddings, healing retreats, marriage conferences, youth survival programs, and apprenticeship programs in farming and construction. When we purchased the land we set out to build it for ourselves and do this for ourselves, and to be a model for other families and friends to create their own communities. Upon purchase of the land, our post went viral and people from all over started commenting, sharing, and asking how could they help us on our mission. So here we are providing an opportunity for all of our extended family and friends who want to be apart of this movement to donate toward bringing amenities and utilities to the land before our big celebratory event on Labor Day Weekend that we are calling the BIG BLACK Campout .We asking for your help to raise $88,000 to help clear the land, hire a team to build roads, pavilions, gazebos, & benches, dig a well for water, create a small camping supply store, connect electricity, and install Wi-FI capabilities to make our Black-owned private land a premier event site for Black families in the age of social distancing. Imagine with us if you will a place full of life and activity where Black families can enjoy the great outdoors, practice sportsmen activities, and connect with nature and the many healing and mental wellness benefits it provides. Will you help us accomplish that dream? We have much more development in the future. We are calling it our 5 Phase Development Plan. Our first step is creating a community not just for our benefit but for yours. So as apart of our fundraiser we have provided a few ways we will honor people that provide NON-Tax Deductible donations (we're not a non-profit organization.) ALL DONATIONS WE RECEIVE BEYOND OUR $88,000 goal will roll over to our second phase of development. In our second phase, our goal is to raise $888,000 for 20 tiny home cabins to be built by Black-Woman owned Mobu Enterprises of Shipping Living based in Macon, GA. Her enterprise will help us set up an apprentice program teaching young people, ex-felons, and veterans how to build shipping container tiny homes on our land. See a digital rendering of our future development below:Thank you so very much for taking the time to read, donate, and/or share! Every donation counts and no donation is too small or too big!

For six years, Southern Fried Queer Pride (SFQP) has built a community in the South amongst Black and brown queer and trans artists and organizers!To date, we have organized a total of 7 festivals in Atlanta, GA and Durham, NC; convening over 60 performers, artists, and educators and 2,000 attendees from throughout the South. Annually, SFQP hosts over 60 events and actions, from marches and community conversations to gallery shows, stage productions, and more. SFQP uplifts Southern queer culture; a culture that is so often overlooked by mainstream media. The time has come for more.SFQP needs your help and partnership to establish a Black queer & trans owned community space/center in Atlanta, GA. Our community is vibrant, resilient, and robust, but lacks brick and mortar spaces to commune, heal, and build. Community centers can play a direct role in providing safe, affirming spaces for Black and brown queer and trans folks, young people, disabled folks, and others marginalized by systemic injustice and lack of infrastructure to thrive. We want to build a space where people have the freedom to grow as individuals, artists, and organizers.

 

UPDATE: With your amazing help, we have reached our first GoFundMe goal of $50,000! We are sincerely grateful for the support and love that you given to SFQP in this effort so far. We are raising the goal to $100,000! Along with buying the property for the community space, we want to also make sure it is accessible to ALL community members, and that it can fit and sustain the capacity to serve everyone. Please help us in this next effort of reaching $100,000!This space will serve as a community arts center and venue space for artists, musicians, and creators as well as a dedicated space to host workshops and facilitate movement building. It will include green space for a community garden and a resource center to accommodate and provide for the needs of our community. And with your support, it will be sustainable.This has always been a core aspect of Southern Fried Queer Pride’s mission. With your help, we can make this a reality and give Atlanta and the South the community space it deserves and needs.Please donate and share this campaign with your families, friends, colleagues, and others!

We’ve met the original goal of buying new press equipment, materials for the next book, and we now are putting together starter money for Felicia's long-time dream of a new studio building. The new studio will be a 2-3 year process with design, permitting, community review, etc., and will require further fundraising down the  road. Felicia would be grateful for any amount you care to give to this fund for construction of the new Moving Parts Press. Now rising, with your help...We appreciate all contributors taking this action at a time when our energies are needed in so many places. Ten percent of this fund will go to victims of the fires in the Santa Cruz Mountains. And keep an eye out for a new broadside, the proceeds of which will also benefit victims of the CZU Lightning Complex Fire in the Santa Cruz Mountains.**************Moving Parts Press  was founded in 1977 by Felicia Rice to create and publish limited edition artists’ books, broadsides, and prints. Her home and letterpress printing studio in the Santa Cruz Mountains along with 43 years of work went up in smoke in the CZU Lightning fire on August 20, 2020. Felicia and her husband Jim are safe and have relocated to Mendocino, CA, but Felicia is going to need to rebuild her workshop from scratch to be able to continue to work. Your generous donations so far have allowed a new dream to grow, of not just surviving, but thriving in a new building. Felicia writes, “As a printer, my job is to confront complex issues and render my response in book form. As an artist, my job is to do so with profound integrity. As a publisher, my job is to make these issues public. As printers have done every decade since Gutenberg, I’m here to argue for a more just society.”Funds raised will provide for inkjet and laser printers, an 11” x 17"" scanner, a Vandercook proof press, a platemaker and filtration system, a paper cutter, a print drying rack, the myriad hand tools and inks needed to print, and provide seed money for literally building a new shop for Moving Parts Press.75% of the edition of her most recent book, The Necropolitics of Extraction , burned before it could be sold and distributed to buyers -- those copies would have funded her next project, Justice and Injustices. We would like to be able to fund the materials for that book as well, to get Moving Parts Press  back on its game producing new work.   Visit Moving Parts Press  for all of Felicia's work. More on her masterwork, DOC UNDOC  here.A new article has just come out on KQED, titled After Wildfire a Family of Artists Faces the Cultural Loss of Climate Change .There's also another GoFundMe page started the day of the fire by Felicia's son Will, here .Much of what was lost in the fire is irreplaceable: type and presses handed down from mentors, an archive of source work that went into creating her lifetime of work, original artwork, and of course, her back stock of limited editions. Felicia is forward-thinking, however, and concentrating on what remains to be done, not what was lost.I was a student at UCSC from 1984-87 and Felicia was one of my teachers there who helped and inspired me to become a letterpress printer. As a teacher, a collaborator, a publisher and an artist, she has influenced many people over her career. I hope Felicia’s community of friends and colleagues in the book and art worlds; artists, poets, and writers; and Moving Parts Press collectors will come together to ensure that this life-changing loss doesn’t end her career as a maker and an artist. Goal:EquipmentInkjet printer/ink $250Laser printer/toner $250Scanner $650Vandercook printing press  $12,000Anderson-Vreeland platemaker requested price $5,000Filtration system requested price $5,000Kutrimmer paper cutter $500Drying rack $500Hand tools $500Inks $500Total ~$25,000Budget for next book:Paper $3,000Plates $3,000Binding $12,000Total ~$18,000Toward building a shop for Moving Parts Press:Architect, construction drawings, permits, contractor costs...Total ~$77,000 and then some...Total goal: $120,000"

Last week we celebrated our 2nd Birthday and hit 500K followers on our Instagram!!!If 5% of our Instagram followers each gave $5 we would easily reach our goal!We know that with this platform comes great responsibility. We do not take that lightly. We have spent much of our time educating this growing, international community.  As we are entering our 3rd year as a team and platform, we want to be even more intentional in how we bring these conversations into the Ugandan context for fellow Ugandans. We believe, fundamentally, that there needs to be a radical shift in the education we receive about history, identity, culture and revolutionary movements around the world.  We spent months considering how we could help make this happen in our city of Kampala. We need to raise $100,000 to make this dream a reality! If you've stuck around long enough, you will know that we have always raised big money for others. We've fundraised for legal fees on multiple cases, the launching of a safe shelter for survivors of sex trafficking, solidarity for Black-lead Philly based non-profits doing important work as well as investing in our Ugandan-lead community projects. We want to break down where this $100,000 will be going:1) Complete start up costs to open a libratory library and cafe that will serve multiple purposes. This space will be the first of its kind in Uganda, providing the public access to books they may otherwise not know about or have access to. Books written by Angela Davis, Kwame Nkarumah, Steve Biko, Marcus Garvey, Walter Rodney, Dr. Amos Wilson, Audre Lorde and Franz Fannon. Biographies written about Malcom X, Fred Hampton, Assata Shakur, Patrice Lamumba, Miriam Makeba and Thomas Sankara.Safe, protected spaces are more important than ever. Especially when you are actively working to combat systems of oppression. This will be a space for gathering, educating, organizing and mobilizing for the revolution. The coffee shop / cafe will provide a unique space to enjoy a meal or a cup of coffee while reading something from our library.  This space will provide jobs in our community and, in the long run, will help us generate income to more sustainably fund our work and the work of our partner projects.2) Bringing a lawyer onto the team has been long overdue. We've worked closely with a number of lawyers both in the USA and here in Uganda to defend our work and to secure representation for those who could not access legal support on their own. It has become very clear over the last 2 years that we need a lawyer on the team to help make us stronger and more strategic in the way we fight and protect ourselves in the process.  This lawyer will be paid a retainer monthly and is based here in Kampala. 3) Financially investing in the 6 Ugandan-lead partner projects we work with around the country. We want to help strengthen the important work they are already doing. As we have watched our platform grow, it has remained a top priority for us to see these organizations amplified and invested into. We don't exist to only critique what is being done poorly but to show you examples of how things can be done ethically.

Fine Dine Front Lines is a non profit organization coming to the immediate aide of suffering restaurants and front line workers. Initially we were focusing on medical staff in cancer related fields well as immediate areas of need within healthcare facilities and began growing from there.Pivoting the ""Give"" mentality by providing new and potentially consistent revenue streams to restaurateurs. Donations generate purchase orders for 100+ meals prepared by kitchens that could use the financial boost. Allows restaurants to produce work, generate revenue and contribute to the community through high quality meals volunteers deliver at no charge to front line workers.How this started:In 2019 my daughter was diagnosed with Non Hodgkins Lymphoma and I with AML Leukemia. Simultaneously. 16 months of chemotherapy had us living in hospitals being nursed back to life by front line workers and their hospitals. We wanted to give back and decided to feed them lunch. In 4 weeks I delivered 1400 meals out of my car with personal finances and the gracious support of a few.  The demand was clear and our focus is direct.  As of today I've relapsed with my Leukemia and am hopefully headed to bone marrow transplant so I'm in hospital most the time literally on the front lines. This motivates me to continue the mission which we can do based on donations and community partnerships.Our website will be functional soon with inclusive fundraising options. We have provided a couple informational pages in the meantime that show the efforts. www.finedinefrontlines.comhttps://www.facebook.com/finedinefrontlines https://www.linkedin.com/company/47612599 https://www.instagram.com/finedinefrontlines/ #SmallBusinessRelief #RugbyCares Thank you Seattle Saracens and Seattle Rugby community for your support!"

Kids from predominantly Black and brown neighborhoods have lots of dreams they can’t afford, and not enough networked role models to help them figure out how to get over that hump.

We have been fortunate to start our business in downtown Seattle -- the only 100 percent Black-owned restaurant in the neighborhood -- but we know that’s not where the Black and brown community resides. Jerk Shack isn’t leaving downtown, but we are compelled to help our community and bring opportunity to neighborhoods that need it.

Our plan is to start in our city, Seattle, by buying land and building a Jerk Shack in a shipping container, so we’re initiating a Land Fund to help us purchase land in a South Seattle neighborhood like Rainier Beach, Skyway or Renton. 

The vision:
Jerk Shack II would help us achieve the scale we need to serve the community by providing our employees with health insurance, child care assistance, tuition assistance and college scholarships. We’re inspired by Dick’s Drive-In (one of my favorites) that serves its community by providing all of those benefits. Of course, most Dick’s are in predominantly white neighborhoods -- I want to create a source of community like that in Black and brown neighborhoods.

Creating a new, fast casual Jerk Shack with a shipping container concept will be a scalable way to bring the restaurant -- and its associated opportunity -- to any neighborhood. We’d like to test the concept in Seattle, and then recreate it in neighborhoods up and down the West Coast. 

People say the system is broken. Well, it works just fine for those it was built by. I want to create a new system by setting an example of entrepreneurship, community, and social economic stability in the neighborhoods that don’t benefit from the current system. I want to show the younger generation that a person that looks like them and comes from the same place as them can create opportunities that benefit the community as a whole. 

Please join me and donate to this land fund so we can continue to expand as a community together, and build a legacy for the next generation. ~Chef Trey Lamont

The letter had no return address. It read, “Please Paint Me! :( Eye sore – Your Neighbors. Thanks”.The neighbors were unaware of the circumstances that lead to having to forgo repairs to their home. The house has been in the family for more than 75 years and is the current home to Jimmy and Marilyn Curcuru. Their daughter and mothers caretaker Lynanne also lives in the home. Marilyn is wheelchair bound and has been battling MS for almost 30 years. Jimmy recently recovered from a quadruple bypass. This loving family is well known in Gloucester and most know the hardships they have faced.Having heard of the letter Gloucester residents went into action. The ideas began to come together on how to help this family.In the words of their son Jimmy, “then the greatest city in the world, Gloucester, came to the rescue as they always do for their own.” Jimmy went on to state, “We don’t care who wrote it. We want to enjoy the love and support of this great city we live in. I want to thank everyone for everything you have done and are going to do.”Harvest Moon Builders joined the group, visited the house, and provided an estimate of the work.  They eliminated their management costs and cut their overhead and profit in half.  All equating to thousands of dollars in savings.  Ace Hardware  quickly committed cash and materials to the fund. Hundreds of donors were ready and waiting.In the words of Mayor Sefatia Giambanco Romeo Theken, “I watched this evolve from it’s inception. We knew the community would come together and collectively help this family. That’s Gloucester. That’s what we do.”~~~ALL DONATIONS WILL GO DIRECTLY TO THE FAMILY / GENERAL CONTRACTOR.  THE GO FUND ME GOAL IS THE EXACT ESTIMATE FROM THE GENERAL CONTRACTOR.

In the Bronx, 31 percent of all children live in food insecure homes; that is, one in four – do not always know where their next meal is coming from. In light of these numbers, Food Bank For New York City called for enactment of the New York City Council’s proposal that free school lunch be provided to all children in the City’s public schools, noting that it would help end the stigma surrounding free school lunch.

With most summer programs canceled due to COVID-19 we want to assure that children have at least one hot meal 3 times a week to fill their bellies and help fill the growing meal gap that exists for struggling families.

100% of your donation will go to food prep and packaging. We are so grateful for your assistance in getting our Full Heart Full Bellies Initiative funded as these children need your help in this ongoing fight! "

For too long, many in our country have had blinders on and it is unacceptable. Inclusivity and diversity have long been hallmarks of Pagliacci. It is forever who we are. Two of our core values; respect and care for employees and do the right thing were formed based on the premise of inclusivity and acceptance.  Yet, we recognize that we must do more.  The work we have been doing on equity and inclusivity needs to continue at Pagliacci in a much bigger way.Since 2018, we have partnered with the organization, Community Passageways, many of you have been involved. The work of Dominique Davis (founder and CEO), and the entire team at CP, is truly inspiring. Their dedicated efforts support the most vulnerable among us. Every day, they fight to save the lives of young adults, mostly African American, by replacing the school-to-prison pipeline with a school-to-life pathway. EVERY DAY. This work is done by the most caring, strong and compassionate group of individuals.  These are just a few of the reasons why we are doubling down on our support for Community Passageways. In addition to the mentoring, the jobs, the pizza and the financial support we have been providing, today, we are writing a check to CP for an additional $10,000 and sponsoring a matching fund. For any contribution to CP, Pagliacci will match up to an additional $10,000. If you, your co-workers or your friends contribute, Pagliacci will match it.  If we come together, we will raise $30,000.

Mesa, AZ	77170	250000	1.5K	47 days 00:39:00.952241000	848	1.4K	1.4K	Three years ago, Amanda and I drove to the Gilbert Farmers Market for our weekly bread from a small garage bakery called Proof, only to discover that the owner was moving away. I had a crisis in that moment. Proof was a weekly routine. Having real, quality naturally leavened bread made the way our ancestors made it was an important part of my weekly ritual, and provided grounding after divorce had destabilized my personal life and previous business. I called the former owner first thing on Monday, and drove to meet him at his garage. That day changed our whole life. By Wednesday I started showing up to Jared Allen's garage and learning how to bake for the first time. Within two weeks the bakery was in our home garage, and we were on our own. We have been baking under Arizona Cottage Food Laws, and the bakery has transformed over the past three seasons. In the beginning, we didn't even have a mixer. We were baking as though we were in the Middle Ages.We made this space work. In fact, little by little we began to build a sustainable business. Amanda and I left our other jobs within the first year. By year 2 we had taken Proof from one Farmers Market to three, and desperately needed to buy equipment as we worked literal 20 hours days trying to keep up. In the past two seasons we have also built onto our garage ourselves with the help of my dad. We have been careful to be good neighbors, and good community members. You can drive by our bakery and have no clue that its anything other than a house with a big garage, a pretty common thing in our neighborhood. Unfortunately, one neighbor began phoning in complaints to the City of Mesa about a year ago. He was upset that there were regularly 3-4 cars parked on the street in front of our home, and that our delivery truck was in our driveway. I did my best to make it right. I had to make it right. By this point we were employing a number of people, serving a large amount of customers, and making a future in this line of work. We were also facing large personal issues. Our daughter has a rare genetic disease called Friedreich's Ataxia. Working from home gave us a sense of peace that we could meet her needs, but still do something that we love. During the early days of COVID, Proof became a safe-haven for a number of people that had worked with us part time on Saturdays, and then lost their regular jobs. Our crew members receive full health benefits, and get a chance to bring products of real value to the community. As a business, we are big contributors to a newly created local grain economy. The majority of our flour comes from Hayden Flour Mills, a local stone mill in Queen Creek. The grains they mill are grown here in Arizona. Our business supports many other small businesses, in some cases almost exclusively, like our chocolate partner DNA Chocolate out of Chandler. I poured a parking pad for my employees on my property, and planted 14 large Ficus trees around it. I moved our delivery truck to a nearby storage facility, and now only pull it here once a week to load up for Farmers Markets. Unfortunately, these efforts weren't enough. Our neighbor had discovered an old city ordinance that did not allow for non-resident employees in our zoning district, and focused his attention on that. Back in August, the Vice Mayor and Head of Code Compliance came to our home bakery, sat at our table, ate our bread, and offered support in our inevitable transition. We knew that one day Proof will have to move, but we also knew that financially we simply weren't there yet. In year one Proof wasn't bringing in enough even to support our family. In fact, Amanda sold her first home in Tempe, and used the proceeds to pay for Proof's 2018 season. In year two, we spent all our profits buying proper ovens, mixers, and necessary equipment to actually have a shot at doing this business. We also built our first addition onto the garage. Just this past winter, my dad and I built an RV garage that gave us all the space we need to continue our work comfortably. As we sat at the table with the city leaders, we told them of our daughters situation, and also of the fact that we really needed another 18 months to move on our own. Even though at that meeting they offered verbal support and encouragement, just 4o days later they determined that in fact we couldn't have the time we needed, and that Proof needed to be out of this facility by mid January...just 4 months away. We were devastated. Having worked so hard for three years we started to see our dream slip away. Commercial buildings are expensive. We didn't want to work with a big property developer. We always had an idea to save and buy a place. Then last Sunday I took a drive, and saw a space that didn't have the commercial real estate signs...just a phone number to a man. Miraculously, it is a space that we could see ourselves in. Turning the corner we have decided that we must move forward. Proof has a value in our life, the lives of our crew members, and the community at large. We are taking the plunge, and building a retail bakery in Downtown Mesa. It'll be a place where you can walk in, have a hot beverage and enjoy a pain au chocolat while you overlook an open concept bakery and watch us make sourdough breads and pastry. It'll be a community space geared towards bringing everyone closer to the source of their local food. The space itself is suitable for us to continue serving Farmers Markets around the Valley, and performing the home delivery program that we started during COVID. However, between us and the building is a daunting expense, that we didn't have sufficient time to prepare for. Your help will allow us to keep Proof as special as it has been. It will prevent us from having to make compromises that change Proof's identity, like cheaper ingredients, or less compensation for our crew. It will prevent us from having to take on a second mortgage of debt to outfit a new building, when we already have a perfectly functional one. The funds raised will be put to use to transform the building in Downtown Mesa from its current state, to one that can accommodate the bakery. Architecture will come first, followed by permitting, construction, and finally the expense of moving the bakery. We will complete the project by early 2021, and smoothly transition Proof from cottage to commercial. You help will save our livelihood, and the livelihoods of over a dozen families that rely on the company. Your help will allow this local food economy to have a small light in this catastrophic year. Our business was fortunate to remain stable in recent months, but now we face existential crisis. Words cannot adequately describe the great level of appreciation we will all have for every small offer of help we can receive in this time. We are a community bakery, and in this moment we desperately need our community's help.

We will gather the voices of museum workers offering and asking for aid and, together, we will advocate for a transformation of museum culture that will center dignity, justice, and humanity.We are currently fundraising $50,000 and will distribute $500 each to 100 applicants. Applications for funding will open once we hit our initial fundraising milestone of $10,000. Funding will be available in multiple rounds. Who is eligible for aid? Any museum worker in the U.S. who has been laid off, furloughed, or otherwise severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Funds are intended for museum workers in the most precarious financial situations, even pre-crisisWho should donate?Museum workers who are still employed, people who love museums, museum board members, museum donors, and anyone looking to support people who bring arts and culture to you daily. We recognize that even for those museum workers who have not been adversely affected by pay cuts and job losses, many are still on tight budgets. Small acts of solidarity add up to a movement! If 5,000 people donated $12 (or 1% of one stimulus check) right now, we would easily meet our initial goal and then some. If you have more than $12 to give, we gratefully welcome your support. If you would like to donate through our fiscal sponsor, email [email redacted].For more info and to apply, check out https://bit.ly/museumworkerfund.

For communities that live in the shadows or have been neglected by traditional institutions of power, the Covid-19 pandemic has created new life-threatening challenges with few places to turn for help. Until We Do It aims to fill the void by making those who are often last in line our first priority. Our goal is to distribute 50M masks to the communities most at-risk for Covid-19: black and brown communities, the homeless, Native American communities, the elderly, working families and rural communities. A look at how Covid-19 is ravaging these communities:**In data compiled from 35 states and the District of Columbia, the APM Research Lab found that Black Americans are dying at 2.7 times the rate for White Americans.**The health authority for the Navajo Nation, which includes areas of Arizona, Utah and New Mexico, reported 1,197 positive coronavirus cases and 44 deaths. If it were a state, it would rank third in the country for confirmed cases per 100,000 population, behind only New York and New Jersey.**In Sumter County, Alabama only 375 people total have been tested for the virus, 87 of whom tested positive -- an 23% positive test rate that exceeds the rate of infection for other hotspots across the country.We partner with local organizations with proven legacies of serving these groups to assess the needs of their clients, and then leverage our network of donors to collect the funds, supplies and resources required to meet those needs. Every single dollar of your donation goes to supporting our mission of getting protective gear into vulnerable communities. $1 purchases two masks that will be distributed directly to those who need it most.Until We Do It operates under the belief that we can’t wait for someone else to step up and help those who are suffering in the shadows. Solving the most critical problems that we face might seem impossible -- until we do it. www.untilwedoit.orgWe are in the process of applying for our tax exemption status. Once we receive that status all donors will be promptly notified as your donations for this year can and will be marked as tax deductible. Thank you for your patience and continued support!

Thank you for stopping by! My name is Lisa Clinton and I have created this campaign after years of experience with the prison industrial complex. Four decades, to be exact. This is one solution to creating the world that we radicals are scheming and dreaming of. From the decades of abuse at the hands of the carceral state, the quality of Black Womxn’s lives are reduced to the bare minimum. When we are thrown in cages that are not adequate enough for a dog, it not only dehumanizes, it also takes a huge toll on our mental, spiritual, physical, and emotional well-being. Most don’t know how challenging it is to merely survive after a person has a felony on their record. Then add Black on top of that. Then add Womxn. I could add more descriptors, but I’ll stop there. To make matters worse, when we are released from these horrific conditions, we are dropped in the middle of nowhere. Left to end up in homeless shelters, after losing everything we own, and then treated as if we are threats rather than people who need help. Please read further to understand this important work. Support and stand in solidarity if you should feel called to. Thank you for each and every contribution to my BIG work!! Lisa xoxo R.E.S.I.S.T.

We warmly invite you to join the R.E.S.I.S.T. campaign, a vision led by formerly incarcerated Black womxn who include caregivers, sex workers, and mothers to hold, nurture, and heal themselves and our sisters in experience/struggle.This campaign is centered on providing the resources, healing, tools and build a place where these words can thrive and live. In today’s world, there are a lot of social ills. For people who have been impacted by a lack of resources, care, access and community, it is often harder and inaccessible to be a part of something bigger than ourselves. For formerly incarcerated people, who are impacted by the prison industrial complex, harm has and continues to be done. With the pandemic and the uprisings, these realities have come to head and without solutions, there will be more harm and hurt. WE NEED TO HEAL R.E.S.I.S.T. will be a place of pause and breath, nourishment and growth; wholly different than the cold and violent systems of a racist government so many of us have been trapped in.We are raising support so we can do the careful work to ethically find and steward Indigenous land and build a green, sustainable nest to house our return to cooperation and community.  We are done hoping for lucky and love is how we R.E.S.I.S.T.R.E.S.I.S.T. stands for Rebuilding Economic Sustainability In Solidarity Together. This campaign is a solution. It’s a solution that is backed up by research, data, history and now, leaders in movement who want to make something for the long term and sustainable for the future. We want to buy land, support research and operations and bring the team together. To build a place where those who want to farm, teach, skill up and become leaders in the world can without dealing with violence, harm and hurt.Therefore, in order to create solutions, we want to create a place, a center and a home for the people, by the people.

Portions of the Great Longfellow community are unrecognizable due to looting and fires in South Minneapolis.  The Third Precinct Police Station is located in Greater Longfellow, which meant we were a focal point for both righteous peaceful protest but also the violent destruction. Now burned and vandalized, this area was a hub of community activity with businesses and non-profits that provide essential resources and jobs. We must rebuild and we need your help now. The Longfellow Community Council is the neighborhood organization for the Greater Longfellow community. Racial equity is central to the work we do. We will rebuild a stronger and more just community. Our initial assessment finds that 31 buildings have been completely destroyed, including 3 major grocery stores, and 2 pharmacies. Beyond that at least 49 other businesses sustained significant damage. Many are locally- and minority-owned. We are raising money to implement a three-pronged strategy to aid in rebuilding our community: (1) Food Security, (2) Safety & Security, and (3) Business Restoration (details below.) COVID-19 has already taken an economic toll throughout the US, including Greater Longfellow. Without financial assistance, many of these small businesses are unlikely to recover. The potential loss of these businesses would negatively impact the whole community (Note: many business insurance policies don’t cover damage caused from rioting). Thank you for your compassion and donations.__________________________ 1. Food Security: Part of the funds raised will help our residents who have been impacted by the indefinite loss of food access because of the 3 destroyed grocery stores . Since public transportation is also disrupted, many are struggling to get to necessary supplies. These funds will also be used to support food banks and other meal assistance programs over the long-term.2. Safety & Security: Many in our neighborhood initially felt helpless as they watched their community burn . Residents have now come together working tirelessly to clean up , support each other, and help secure our community. These funds will be directed towards safety needs, including safety lighting for places left dark by destruction, graffiti removal supplies, reflective vests for neighborhood patrols and other community requests.3. Business Restoration: With these funds, we will coordinate short and long-term support for rebuilding businesses. First, we’ll develop a Small Business Assessment & Stabilization Plan to survey the damage and provide a roadmap for businesses to rebuild. Secondly, we’ll create a Small Area Development Plan to help residents take an active role in future development as things are rebuilt.

Nearly a decade later, we uncovered evidence showing that both of these witnesses lied under oath. And yet, Rojai remained in prison for a crime he did not commit.Rojai has always maintained his innocence, turning down plea offer after plea offer - the lowest one for five years - because he refused to confess to a crime he didn't commit.  In 2014, another man confessed to the murder, and he has continued to do so, including under oath. In 2016, the Innocence Project at UVA School of Law began representing Rojai in his fight for justice.On July 1, 2020, Rojai received a conditional pardon from Virginia Governor Ralph Northam. Later that afternoon, Rojai walked out of prison the same innocent man who entered it 24 years prior. Rojai has won back the freedom that he never should've lost, and now he needs our help. From life's necessities to larger items, Rojai deserves our help getting back on his feet. This GoFundMe page will help Rojai with everything from clothing and groceries to major living expenses. Having gone away when he was just a 16-year-old boy and now reentering the world a 40-year-old man, Rojai has a lot to catch up on. We can promise you that your contribution will make a major impact for a wonderful man whose radiant positivity is a model example to us all.Legal Details and Other Helpful Information:Who is managing this GoFundMe?This GoFundMe page is managed by law student volunteers working with the Innocence Project at UVA School of Law, which has represented Rojai Fentress since 2016. Where are you based?We are based in Charlottesville, Virginia. What is your relationship to Rojai Fentress?Rojai Fentress has been our client and friend since we took on his case in 2016.

It started with a vision ­– two lifelong friends breathing life back into a local corner bar.  Dan Roth and Ray Capone took ownership of Partners, an established village pub of nearly 100 years, in 2013. Laughing as they landed on the name Still Partners, knowing that the deep-rooted history ingrained within the community was something to be embraced as they started on this new journey. Yet, it was very much - still Partners. With time, Still Partners became an early dinner hot spot for young families. It became the hub of Sea Cliff's music culture. It served up the heartbeat of a community alongside its gastropub entrees and craft beers. It became an integral part of Sea Cliff. With Still Partners, Dan & Ray radiated life in our quiet village. And then CV-19 hit. Doors were locked. Jobs were eliminated. The silence of the music, deafening. Meeting the needs of the community, as bills piled up, became the goal. Swaying through uncertainty as each new advancement and roadblock danced on, Dan & Ray went above and beyond to help those in need -- even as they worried about how they would continue to support their own families financially through the crisis. Through it all, it’s Still Dan and Ray. It's Still Partners. And it's time for us to help our friends.I am not going to sugarcoat it. Things aren't good. But collectively,  we can change that. I organized this fundraiser because Dan and Ray are struggling, yet no matter how difficult things ever get for them, they always stop everything to help us. They continually give back to this community and make it a better place for all of us. They are our friends, our neighbors, and an integral part of making Sea Cliff the wonderful place that it is. To quote the duo’s longtime inspiration Bob Dylan, “When you’ve got nothing, you’ve got nothing to lose.” Help our friends and their families get through this crisis and mobilize our community the same way Dan and Ray have always mobilized for us.Side note:

While these funds are being directed into Dan’s account - Dan is splitting every penny equally - as they do with Still Partners - with Ray Capone, his life long pal who he convinced to open this crazy bar.

Perez affectionately known as ""Joser"" or ""Dr. Phil"" leaves a irreplaceable presence with not only the people who worked with him, but the citizens who he treated and helped.  It was not uncommon that he would spend his own personal money to buy medications for people who were less fortunate and cannot afford them, often he was found not only providing excellent medical care but offering a shoulder to lean on to anyone who needed it. He was a prodigious firefighter who worked tirelessly to always become better. He dedicated his life to helping others.  His generosity and  compassion for people will be deeply missed. The funds will go to his wife and children to assist them with present and future expenses the family will incur. Thank you everyone for your donation."

Nathaniel Bieber, our vibrant and dear 16-year-old friend, has been in the pediatric ICU since September 6 following sudden cardiac arrest caused by a rare heart condition. As of the start of this campaign, Nathaniel has undergone cardiac surgery and has regained consciousness, but has not been released from the ICU. His rehabilitation will include cognitive work. The team caring for him are hopeful that with rehab, he will make a good recovery. This campaign is to support the family as they plan for Nathaniel's ICU care, surgery and other medical interventions, rehabilitation, and the collateral costs of adjusting to life with ongoing care. The current goal may very well increase as the costs of even just a few days in the pediatric ICU, even with insurance paying its portion, become clear.  Nathaniel is a high-school junior. What can I say, as a mom to one of his closest friends? He and his siblings are some of the most shining humans you'll meet. At 16, he is full of promise and enthusiasm for life. Even after all he's been through, even with a long road ahead of him to full recovery, Nathaniel is smiling and making new friends.For those who might not have encountered the Biebers before, it's my pleasure to celebrate this beloved family with a few words. Ed Bieber, Nathaniel's dad, has been educating children and adults about the natural world in Rockland County for over 40 years. He's inspired thousands who have observed nature through his eyes to a greater love for the world and its living things. Even after being diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease soon after Nathaniel's birth, Ed continued to run the Nature Place Day Camp, and while he has had to withdraw in recent years, to this day he remains committed to the vital task of helping children to fall in love with the world.Jill Bieber, Nathaniel's mom, recently decided to devote her full attention to the partnership that Ed will need as his Parkinson's advances. Before this, she was an early childhood educator and then became an advocate for elder care. She is ever ready to turn her knitting skills and her loving warmth to caring for her community and the people around her. She is the kind of friend who will never share a complaining word about herself if she knows you are in need . . . I doubt that anyone who's been with her in recent days has seen her without her usual serene smile, but as an old friend (my own youngest son was born within a month of Nathaniel and they've been close friends ever since), I can attest on her behalf that Nathaniel's ordeal has been almost beyond bearing. Jill and Ed have been gratefully sustained by the community's outpouring of love. Many have asked: How can we help? This is how. Please contribute what you can to this campaign and share this fundraiser with friends, family, and colleagues, along with Nathaniel's story. That's all. Thanks for reading the Biebers' story! And on the Biebers' behalf, thanks for contributing toward Nathaniel's ICU hospitalization, surgical and other interventions, rehabilitation, and ongoing care. Donna Miele is a long-time friend of the Bieber family. Contact her with questions through this fundraiser.

It does feel like we are starting from scratch.  We are planning and will work very hard at returning and being ready to serve you by May 1st , 2021 (if not sooner).Bill, the kids and I have been truly overwhelmed by everyone's kindness, thoughtfulness and generosity. Our hearts are filled with deep gratitude- Tourterelle wouldn't exist without you all.   We want to thank you and we will keep you all posted on the re-building progress through our social media outlets and website. We can't wait to have you back dining at Tourterelle.With so much love & gratitude, Christine, Bill, Kamille, Juliette & Jacques Snell""Let us be grateful to the people who make us happy: they are the charming gardeners who make our souls blossom""          ProustUPDATE 7/7/20:  WOW!  The campaign hit its original goal within eight days of launching.  It speaks to the love and community of the people who know the Snells and have visited Tourterelle over the past 11 years.  From Christine:  ""I can't believe how generous people have been through this GoFundMe Campaign. We are absolutely blown away and speechless by so much kindness and generosity, we have no idea how to begin to even say thank you.""We will keep this campaign live for another week or so. The rebuilding will take 6-9 months and although there will be some insurance coverage for a big part of it, there will definitely be a need to help complete the work.If you know of anyone who may still want to donate, please share.  And thank you, thank you for helping to show the love for this wonderful family.UPDATE 6/29/20:   Thank you so much to everyone who has donated to this fundraiser so far!!  The Snells are so incredibly grateful and deeply touched by the show of support for their family and their rebuilding efforts.  We are only about $3,000 away from the original goal and it has been less than a week since we started this campaign.  Now that the dust is settling somewhat, it is clear that these monies will go a very long way to helping Tourterelle during the months ahead as they put their lives and restaurant back together.  Based on the response from the community and the ongoing financial strain of this unfortunate event, we plan to keep the fundraiser live for a few more weeks to allow those just learning of this opportunity to donate to this effort.  This last week has been a testament to how much Bill and Christine are loved by so many and we can all take pride in knowing how much our support will provide them with our community strength and spirit throughout the months ahead.Please share this link with anyone you think who may still want to donate.  Thank you all!!June 22, 2020:  On Friday morning, June 19, a fire started in the kitchen of Tourterelle, causing severe damage to the original 224-year-old building including smoke and structural damage.Owned and operated for the last 11 years by Bill and Christine Snell, Tourterelle and the Snell family have been a foundation of our community.  They  have hosted our families for special events of all kinds, our community fundraising events, music nights, weddings, family birthday celebrations,  special gatherings of friends and family and all with their warmth, kindness and unparalleled service and food. We have all experienced the grace and generosity of the Snells over these past many years and we would like to help their family recover from this setback during this very challenging time.  We are raising  money to help  Bill and Christine while they rebuild their restaurant and inn.  The money from this fundraiser will go directly to them  for whatever they need in order to get Tourterelle up and running once again.  We want to show the Snells how much we appreciate having them in our community and to return some of their kindness and generosity.   Please share this fundraiser with anyone you know who would like to contribute.  Thank you!!!Photo Burlington Free Press"

But what if, instead, they recognized and invested in Black peace-makers as a solution?Last Fall, when neighbors in an area east of Lake Merritt, in Oakland, feared for their safety regarding gun violence and drugs being sold in a local park, their first instinct was to call the police. But that didn’t solve the problem. In fact, it only increased the danger of violence, as OPD is notorious for its punitive and traumatic methods.Luckily, a man named Kentrell Killens — a Black peace worker and professional Life Coach for young men, born and raised in Oakland — generously offered us his expertise, speaking with multiple sides and drawing on his personal relationships to seek resolution. He even gave us his private cell number, and told us to call him if conflict went down. He would come right over from his home in Richmond, and personally put his life at risk to de-escalate. Isn’t that powerful?Within a few months, the neighborhood calmed. Dozens of people now walk their dogs and babies around the park on a daily basis. And more of us have met each other, recognize each other, and can reach out to each other for help.Kentrell succeeded in promoting safety where Oakland police could not.That's why we're challenging our community — and all of Oakland, and beyond — to raise the approximate $100,000 disparity between a salary + benefits of 1 Oakland police officer, and a community worker like Kentrell.Black and Brown community workers engaged in effective peace-making measures are chronically underpaid by city government and NGOs. For example, a community worker employed by the City of Oakland’s Department of Violence Prevention currently costs the city approximately $107K annually (salary and benefits), whereas the community resource police officer for the Eastlake beat costs the city more than double that figure — $232K annually. This disparity is evidence of the City’s misplaced priorities.Of course, eventually, we want the City government to fund people like Kentrell instead of police. A whole #DefundOPD coalition is working on redirecting funds away from militarized policing and into community-based services. But in the meantime, we need Kentrell and his organization of fellow mentors, the Good Brotha Network, to be resourced to do their work NOW.So we are going to fill that gap — by raising $100,000 for Kentrell to magnify his peace work.This fundraiser is not only a symbolic act in defiance of the current oppressive order, but is an actual investment in community workers, who spend countless unpaid hours building relationship with those most marginalized by the system. When wealthy Oakland communities perceive that there is insufficient policing to protect their property, they have frequently invested in private security firms that employ the same racist tactics of publicly-funded policing. With this fundraising effort, neighbors in Eastlake United for Justice (EUJ) propose another path. We want to invest in the high-skilled, long-term trust-building it takes to grow true community safety.Kentrell’s amazing spirit, his genuine passion for empathy and peacemaking, actually made us feel loved and cared for — not just a problem to be solved. We need more organizations like Kentrell's, the Good Brotha Network: a volunteer organization led by Black community workers that supports struggling community members caught up in the cycle of violence.We must create the world we wish to see, and invest in alternatives to policing and prisons.Join us in the next step of this journey, by donating today!

In 2020, we are challenged to keep the program funded - will you help? AIR programs are typically supported by business sponsors and foundation grants In 2019, $65K in sponsor dollars and grant fund covered costs for training, NPO coaching, technology infrastructure, and other program management costs. Since COVID, those funding sources are few and far between for small nonprofits like Knowbility. As we learn to teach, learn, socialize, evangelize, and innovate in an all-new context, we turn to our community for a new way to fund AIR activities this year. Please donate if you can. Evangelizing Accessibility from the GrassrootsThe Internet is not equally accessible to people with disabilities and AIR shows web pros how to change that. In these times when we are all working, learning, shopping, and participating in civic and social activities remotely, accessibility has never been more important. And yet, the most recent State of Accessibility Report (SOAR ) found that more than 80% of public websites are not accessible. Through the years, the Accessibility Internet Rally (AIR) program has served as the Johnny Appleseed of accessibility, spreading seeds of good design with creativity and joy. AIR introduces web professionals and students to digital accessibility with a fun, friendly web raising competition that benefits community organizations, musicians, and artists. Produced at least once a year in cities as far-flung as Austin, Dallas, Houston, Denver, LA, San Francisco, and Boston, we are now learning to stay home and spread the word in a new way. Thousands of people have been introduced to accessibility in the AIR competition or AccessU - and you may be one of them! Many have gone on to work in accessibility for companies like Pearson, Adobe, Microsoft, Visa, Google, Apple, and Facebook. You will find former AIR participants at startups, digital agencies, and schools as well.  AIR alumni work for large accessibility consultancies like Deque and LevelAccess.  AIR is people-centered and focused on the lived experiences of people with disabilities. We use heirloom seeds rather than industrial methods to change the world of digital accessibility.  And it all began as a community collaboration in Austin, Texas.  The need for accessibility has never been greater - please help us continue to spread the word and change design practices to meet the needs of all people. Please give what you canNo gift is too small. We understand that there are competing needs in these hard times. But if you care about equal access to digital information and interactions, please chip in what you can. Together we can continue to improve understanding and commitment to accessibility. Together we can create an inclusive digital world for people of all abilities.  Thank you.

As you all may know I have been selected to compete in the Miss California USA Pageant in 2021 & I am honored to represent the city of Norwalk as Miss Norwalk USA. Being a woman who is always trying to defy what the world has to say about what women shouldn’t & should do hasn’t always been easy, but it has also NEVER stopped me. To be selected to be apart of the Miss Universe Organization is not only a honor but a blessing because it gives me the platform to continue speaking for the women who are afraid to speak for themselves when it comes to equality in sports, in jobs & equality overall for women. 


While competing, if it is Gods will, I will be taking my journey all the way to the MISS UNIVERSE Pageant, the biggest pageant in the world. As a honors student & athlete, there aren’t many things I can do between class & practice to fundraise, so I am taking any sponsorship & donations. This will help with pageant fees, travel fees, pageant coaching, wardrobe & make up fees & other necessities etc. As always, thank you so much for your all your support & I look forward to making you proud!"

In order to do this, I need more exposure in events (like the Swing Thought Tour events, tour qualifiers, etc.). Graduating from the Golf Academy of America and being employed as an assistant golf professional at Barefoot Resort in Myrtle Beach has given me the background to get started in my career in the golf industry, but my dream is to play professional golf as a career. Having cystic fibrosis has actually been a blessing to me in a way. It has given me the determination and drive to not let anything stop me from pursuing my dream. Having to fight and work harder than many has made me into the responsible go-getter that I am today. We all face ups and downs, but I have learned to persevere through difficult times and will continue to do so in attempting to go after my vision.Before becoming a professional, I had won four tournaments on the Golf Week Amateur Tour and was nominated as ""Player of the Year"". For the past three years, I have been playing in professional tournaments. Having gained this experience, I believe I am at a point where I can try to make my dream a reality; however, I don't have the funding needed to do so. Due to COVID, I have been out of work for the past 5 months and am unable to return to work because of my health condition and the risks involved. On a positive note, this time off of work has allowed me to devote even more time in practicing and getting ready for my future career.I am hoping to raise enough money to help cover the extremely expensive entry fees for the types of tournaments I need to play in to get recognized. Not only that, but I am also hoping to raise enough money to help cover the cost of travel and hotel accommodations associated with these tournaments. The entry fees for the tournaments I am looking to enter range from $800-$1100 each. If at all possible, would you help to support me  in moving forward with my dream, playing golf as a full-time occupation?  Any donations would be greatly appreciated, and I thank you, in advance, for your generosity"

Let me introduce myself, My name is Mikayla Whitehill, I am 15     years old and I just finished up my sophomore year at Jackson Memorial High School.  I represent Jackson in the New Jersey High School Rodeo Association. I have been a member for 3 years.  This association focuses on             western style riding, bull riding and rifle shooting. I am an active competitor in a number of these events. We travel to different states competing throughout the year.       Just this month at state finals, I qualified for nationals in several events: 1st in the state in pole bending, 4th in barrels, 3rd in goat tying  and 4th in rifle shooting. Next month I will be traveling with my mom to Oklahoma for Nationals competing against people from all over the country. We are leaving 7/13/2020 and returning 7/29/2020. We compete for a week. Of course we will be driving with the trailer and two horses.  This is a dream come true!    As you can imagine, this is very costly. Just this past January,I was fortunate enough that my parents bought me my own horse. There are expenditures associated with boarding the horse, maintaining and feeding the horse, ammunition for my rifle along with training, entry fees, transportation and lodging.    I was born and raised in Jackson, a true Jersey Girl through and through. I’m proud to represent my state at a national level. I am writing to seek financial support in the form of a donation or sponsorship from you or your New Jersey business. Your funding will be greatly appreciated and recognized.    I want to thank you for your time and   possible consideration. I will ride with pride for you and your business.

It’s the strongest driving force of humanity. With it, we can achieve the seemingly impossible. Without it, everything seems impossible. ~ Josh Wolf This Oct 4th my crew and I will set out to break the fastest(cycling) record across Kansas a grueling 418 mind-numbing miles, it will take every ounce of strength and willpower I have to keep going—a feeling unfortunately I know all too well…My ride is so much bigger than me. It will take a 7 person crew, 2 officials and an entire community to not only break the record, to even get through it. I cannot do it alone. Musch the same we have an opportunity RIGHT NOW to offer support and help as a community, especially when Covid continues to rattle us in ALL WAYS, physically mentally and everything between.

I recently had the opportunity to participate in the state level National American Miss (N.A.M.) Pageant. It was the best time of my life. I met so many nice, caring, smart, beautiful, and independent women at N.A.M! I was really nervous at first, performing in front of people. But the girls helped me feel confident and welcomed me with open arms. In the end I made it to the national level pageant. I really want to make this dream come true and would be honored to have your sponsorship to help me get there. It’s coming up the week of Thanksgiving (2020) in Orlando, Florida. Every little bit helps.

Thank-you in advance for your support,
Ambrosia

My dream is to become a professional motocross/supercross racer. My passion for motocross started when I was only 2 1/2 years old and that was when I got my first dirt bike. It wasn't until I turned 5 that I was introduced to racing and have been racing ever since. My first big achievement was to participate in one of the biggest Motocross events in the State of California in Mammoth, CA. The excitement of the race, where I had the opportunity to race side by side with ridder much more experienced than I was, the adrenaline rushing though my whole body, the thrill of riding, and the emotions behind being part of such a unique sport, made my passion for dirt biking grow even more. The race environment, challenges that I continue to face and the new goals that I set for myself after every race kept me going stronger and stronger, even in the midst of many adversities.My father is my biggest fan and I am forever grateful for all the sacrifices he has made so I can pursue my dream. My father is my wingman, my mechanic, my transportation coordinator, my paramedic when I get hurt, my motivator, the single most important contributor to my career; but behind of all these, he is a good dad. And being the dad that he is, we end up making a deal. I can continue racing if I bring good school grades. I am proud to say that I will be going into 10th grade with a GPA of 4.25In the past 10 years of racing, I have faced many challenges including injury and financial difficulties. Once I had to take almost a year off of racing due to the cost of training fees, maintenance and repairs, not to mention that I have just finished healing up from an ACL reconstruction surgery last year. Presently, I am feeling the best I have ever felt, especially when I am riding on my motocross. Recently I placed 3rd and 4th in the area qualifiers which qualified me for the regional; and at the regionals, I got a 1st and 2nd in two different categories, giving me 2 spots in the biggest amateur race in the United States - The Loretta Lynn’s Ranch, in Hurricane Mills, Tennessee which will take place from August 3rd to the 8th, 2020.My father and I will be driving from California to Tennessee for the biggest challenge of my life. I am preparing myself physically and emotionally so I can put the performance that can potentially rocket me into the view of big time sponsors. All the biggest names and sponsors of the sport will be there, and this could be my break. We are also preparing ourselves for the trip and need your support to meet all the expenses with this trip like spare parts, riding gear, hotels, meals, practice fees, gasoline, and unexpected things that may happen along the way. I am going to be competing with kids whose parents are able to invest in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. As you all know, I come from a humble household and simply cannot compete at this level. I am counting on my talent, skills and dedication, and with a little help, I will succeed.I would be extremely grateful and humbled if you partner with me helping me to get one step closer to achieving my dream. Being able to go means everything to me. I have been putting a lot of work and effort so I can perform well on this event, and with your support, I will be even more motivated. I would be super thankful if any of you would be able to donate to my cause.Thank you to everyone for reading my story. Stay well and healthy, and I promise to race for you!Rodrigo Borges

We are looking to raise $4,000 to help pay for our travel expenses (gas, lodging and meals) to attend the BASSMASTER High School National Championship tournament at Kentucky Lake, Tennessee in October. Nate and I are seniors at Lakeside High School in Nine Mile Falls, Washington. Since Lakeside does not have a bass club, we fish for and represent the state of Washington through Washington State High School B.A.S.S. Nation which is affiliated with BASSMASTER. As members of B.A.S.S. Nation, we participate in high school bass tournaments which allows us to compete in a sport we love – bass fishing – while learning the value of sportsmanship and conservation of our natural resources. At the end of the tournament season,  BASSMASTER puts on a national championship event giving each state’s 1st and 2nd place winners an opportunity to compete for cash prizes, scholarships, and title of National Champion. Nate and I took 2nd place in Washington state and qualified for the National Championship tentatively (Covid-19) scheduled for October 18-24, 2020 at Kentucky Lake, Tennessee. We hope to put Eastern Washington on the map of winners and take the national title of Champion home with us! This once-in-a-lifetime opportunity requires significant funds to travel cross-country while towing a boat. We live west of Spokane, Washington and the tournament is in Tennessee. It is approximately 4,500 driving miles round trip and 5 days of tournament fishing (2 pre-fish days, 2 qualifier days and 1 championship day). We estimate our expenses to be about $4,000 which covers gas for the truck and boat, and lodging/meals for approximately 13 days (4 days to, 5 days fishing, 4 days return).  To collect enough funds, our plan includes selling tickets for a basket of donated fishing tackle and having a yard sale as well as other fundraising events. Our hope is that these efforts will close the gap on the $4,000 goal. But we know, since Covid-19, money is tight everywhere and it is doubtful that we can raise that much money with these efforts alone. So we set up a GoFundme account to raise the remaining funds necessary to get to Kentucky Lake. We hope to reach our goal by October 1. By supporting us through GoFundme, Nate and I can travel to the tournament with confidence and not have to make a choice between sleeping in the truck or skipping a meal to put gas in the truck or boat. If you could spare a few dollars to help a couple high school bass anglers cover the travel expenses to a once-in-a-lifetime championship bass tournament, your donation would mean more than you can imagine and be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance for your generous gift. You have no idea how much it means to us to have your support. Thank you again! Team Garrett and Nate, Bass Anglers for Life**In the event the tournament is canceled, Nate and I will cancel our fundraiser immediately. Money already collected at the time of cancellation will be used to cover travel costs for the 2020-2021 qualifying tournaments. Each qualifying tournament in Washington state requires travel (gas, lodging and meals), so your generous donations will not be wasted.

Fundraising deadline goal: August 7thThis summer, the team at Innov8MD had an ambitious idea: a free, self-paced virtual program to support student entrepreneurs as they work on their startups, small businesses, and nonprofits over the summer. We wanted to support the students at the earliest stage of the venture-building process, no matter what their experience level or which institution they came from. The student response was overwhelming. We had over 140 applications to the AddVenture pre-accelerator program, and we were determined to accept all of them. Our all-volunteer team worked to design a program - with practically no budget - that could provide education, connection, and mentorship to over 100 students from over 15 different MD high schools, colleges, and universities. And we did! AddVenture has supported ~100 active student participants with a curriculum, worksheets, daily office hours, topic discussions, mentor meetings, and more. As the 6-week program comes to a close, it's time to prepare for the highlight of the program: The AddVenture Demo Day. But we need your help. The AddVenture mentors are 100% volunteer, so we'll need your help in order to fund the 3 Demo Day Prizes for the student entrepreneurs ($500, $250, $250). Whether you can give $10 or $100, any amount helps support Maryland's student entrepreneurs, and allows us to continue to offer free programs such as AddVenture. As Innov8MD is a registered 501(c)(3), your donation is 100% tax deductible. Help us Support Maryland's Student Entrepreneurs! ~The Innov8MD AddVenture Team:

Therefore, the focus of this campaign is to create a pool that will help me make it in Tokyo.  I am raising money to help cover the cost of massage, chiropractor, and travel to meetings, supplements, training equipment, as well as travel to and from races and fees that accompany track field. WE GO THIS! TOKYO HERE WE COME!I am grateful for any contribution or support that you’re able to give.

They made their gymnastics debut at just 3 and 4 years old and have never looked back. Lucy has been offered ""invitation only"" classes twice and is training at level 3 for the USA Gymnastics Junior Olympics (which has very strict requirements). Lucy trains 3 hours a day, 4 days a week with countless hours at home. Emma is on the Xcel team for USA Gymnastics (which is a more relaxed and allows the gymnast a wider range of skills) and will be competing at level Silver. Gymnastics is always on their mind and main topic of conversation. They cannot wait to start class to give their all with a smile on their face. Competitions start in January and funds are needed for uniforms, competitions, and travel expenses. If you are able to help it would mean the world to the girls and to us!

I have decided to run for Miss Long Island with the hopes of providing a source of light and positivity for the black community during such difficult times. In order to compete in this pageant, I have to raise enough money to cover the registration fee, along with other necessary expenses (e.g., a formal evening gown). With that being said, I would really appreciate if you could help out with whatever God puts in your heart. Thank you so much in advance, and I will keep you all updated on this journey.

Friends & Family, 

You might remember my time competing in the Miss Illinois Teen USA pageant system back in high school.  In the years that followed, I was fortunate enough to graduate with a degree from The Walter Cronkite School of Journalism as I continued to pursue my passion for TV production and am currently working as a producer for a local morning show in Arizona!I am now excited to announce that I have been blessed with the opportunity to return to the pageant world and have been selected to compete for the Miss Arizona USA 2021 pageant as Miss Arcadia USA! For the past 5 years, I have been exposed to many local businesses and non-profit organizations through my various positions in TV production, and my love for the community has only continued to grow.Competing in a pageant comes with fees and other costs, which is why I am starting this GoFundMe.  Any amount you can afford to donate would be greatly appreciated in my journey to compete and represent the state of Arizona!  If you are unable to donate, I hope to have you in my corner cheering me on every step of the way! 

Thank you everyone & I love you all! 

xo,Miss Arcadia USA, Faith

NAM is a program that promotes leadership skills.  I was required to develop a resume, do volunteer service, speak publicly in front of a large group, interview with five judges, and demonstrate poise in an evening gown.  I also competed in optionals and won trophies for heart of service, spokesmodel, talent,actress,casual wear, and top model.  The trophy that meant the most to me was first place for "" Heart of Service "".  I donated over 350 hours  the past two years to volunteering.  I  made Build a Bears for blind children, small children getting heart transplants, and have taken bears to orphanages because I believe everyone needs something to hold close when they are scared.  Additionally I tutored students on reading skills, packed care boxes for "" May No Solider go Unloved"" , participated in school projects like the Empty Bowl and Socktober- to get socks for the Homeless. I enjoyed starting a ""Kids for Kindness"" club and accomplished activities.  I have the opportunity to go to Florida for a week at Thanksgiving and represent the city of Hamilton at the National NAM convention . and compete against other states in the National All American Miss pageant.  I would really appreciate your help as a sponsor. I am grateful for my friends and family.   Any donation is tax deductible.  Your gift would help pay for my registration fee, travel expenses, and hotel. if you can't help me at this time, please think of me during Thanksgiving week and wish me luck."

My name is Grace Heepke and in March 2020 I made the United States Pony Club International Games team upon application. I will be traveling to Australia in September 2020 with a team of four other talented riders from the US. I will be gone for two weeks representing the USA. The first week, my team goes on tour and the second, we will compete on Australia’s ponies. We will be in competition with Australia, Great Britain, and Canada. It’s truly a dream come true to get accepted.It was my goal to make the team since summer 2019 when I was approached by an international rider at a PC Regional Games Rally. She asked me if I had considered trying out and that I had the skill to make the team. I had no idea what any of this international stuff meant because it was only my third PC games competition ever. On that day, I never would have imagined I would be where I am now.I was a level D3 in Pony Club and needed to be a C2 just in order to apply. (Go to ponyclub.org for more information on USPC) I had been in Pony Club for less than a year. When I joined Pony Club with my sister, I met a couple of amazing women: Denise Wottowa and Cindy Medina. They, along with many others, got me to where I am now. After being approached by the international rider, Denise and Cindy immediately encouraged me to try out. I studied and practiced for hours so I could rate up to my C2 in two months. It was hard and stressful but I did it with the help of Silver Springs Pony Club, my wonderful family, friends, coaches, trainers, and amazing horses: I rated twice, applied, and got accepted to the USPC International Mounted Games Team. I am so grateful for everyone that helped me get this far! But I need your help too. Travelling internationally is expensive, especially when it is an equestrian team. That being said, my next goal is to fundraise $3,544 to get me to Australia. This money will be going towards land fees, uniforms, luggage, flights, conference calls, and shipping for luggage and uniforms. I am so thankful for any and all donations. I am starting a few projects to raise money: I am selling two of my project horses to raise money, take donations, and accept sponsors.  I understand that the current COVID-19 pandemic has made these last months hard for everyone.If the International Games competition is cancelled, everyone that was accepted this year, automatically is guaranteed a place on the 2021 team.   Thank you to everyone who has helped me with my goals! This means the world to me. Contact Marcy Heepke at 618-559-7746 for more information on how to help! Also see Kestrel the Wonder Pony and Grace and Dove’s Excellent Adventure on Facebook for more information on the horses I am selling.

The entire world has been transformed by the Covid-19 pandemic.   In light of this, legendary B-Boy Wicket put together a team: Lady Jules, Honey Rockwell, and Troublelock to create a way for B-Girls (specifically) to gain wider access to the Breaking community, and receive international attention. Gone are the old barriers that were far too often down socio-economic lines, where the best talent could never be found...the expenses, flights, entry fees, hotels, and having to fund their way - just to compete. This barrier to enter Battles is now gone, and we are now getting to see the tremendous talent of these B-Girls as they compete in the comfort of their own homes and gyms. B-Girls Run the World was founded to give talented girls a chance to submit their skills through video, and a chance to compete with some of the best B-Girls in the world live - online.  The very first B-Girls Run the World competition happened this year, LIVE, and it starred the top 16 B-Girls from countries across the world. Juggling multiple time zones was a feat in itself, and the live competition was smooth and successful.  Since the first competition, the feedback and demand for number 2 have been overwhelming and palpable.  We are now moving forward with B-Girls Run the World 2, which will be recorded and edited for viewers on August 22, 2020.  We are asking for the support and the sphere of influence of our community of viewers to help raise money for this great endeavor and the opportunity to reward the top two winners with prize money worth their weight in talent!The support from our community and supporters means the world to us as we know how difficult it can be to pay your way to get to these Battles not to mention being in a pandemic of epic proportions that has halted any in-person events.We are so grateful for any size donation in support of B-Girls Run The World and we are beyond excited to open up the gates for many other B-Girls ready to take the crown.  Thank you , we sincerely appreciate YOU!  The B-Girls Run The World Team:B-Boy Wicket: Founder/Producer TroubleLock:  Team and Talent coordinator and ProducerLady Jules: Host and BGRTW Team ProducerHoney Rockwell: Judge and BGRTW Team ProducerAsia One: Guest JudgeB-Girl Bonita: Guest JudgeCelebrity DJ: Angie Vee

I will be competing in the 2020 National All - American Miss Pageant this November but I need your help. The expenses all together for this pageant will cost me almost $3,000. That includes all of the gorgeous dresses, the hotel, airfare,  and most importantly my sponsorship fee. I am willing to do whatever I can to get there. As most of you know I am a Full-time nurse and a Full-time nursing student on a fast track to receiving my Bachelor of Science Degree in Nursing. This past July I was struck with a tragedy. I tested positive for COVID -19, which I later found out I was unknowingly exposed by a patient that I was treating. But just like everything else in life I over-came. I beat the virus after spending over 21 days in recovery. I became stronger and worked even harder to not only maintain my 4.0 g.p.a but also win the title of a National American Miss City Queen. To my family and friends ......or whoever is reading this please donate whatever you can 1$, 5$, 10$ and if you can't do that I beg that you share this post.  The bible says “Blessed are those who believe without seeing” - John 20:29. I have been determined since I was 11 years old to live out my dream on this stage. I ask that you all believe in me too.

Being selected by you to represent my home state of Minnesota has been an honor and goal of mine that has taken years to achieve. The journey to the crown has been a humbling and exciting experience that has helped me grow both personally and professionally.  Since being crowned Miss Minnesota International, I have accomplished one of my biggest goals: writing the Big Little Cookbook . This cookbook serves as a unique tool to bring (adult volunteers), Bigs closer to their littles  (local youth/mentees) through cooking and trying new things! When matched with my little sister there was an instant connect through our love of food. Together we have traveled across the state visiting some of Minnesota's best eateries. This cookbook is a culmination of our adventures and each recipe is inspired by our top rated restaurants . As Miss International I will help recruit a new generation of Big Brothers and Big Sisters, bring awareness to the joys of mentorship, and expand the Big Brothers Big Sisters organization to countries that do not have  local chapters like Africa, France, India, and England. Big Brothers Big Sisters of America is the world's largest mentoring program and is currently serving 200,000 children in the United States. Research released in the 1990’s documenting the effectiveness of the BBBS model in America resulted in  heightened demand for BBBS mentoring outside the United States. In 1998, Big Brothers Big Sisters International was established and is now serving more than 30,000 children and youth around the world.  BBBSA and BBBSI are separate legal entities but are joined first by a passion to improve the lives of children and the excellence of the BBBS model of mentoring, and secondly, by a cooperative agreement which empowers BBBSI to expand BBBS services to countries outside the United States.It is my mission to share my platform, The Joys of Mentorship with children around the world because of the lasting effects that it has on our youth. Children with mentors have a 89% high school graduation rate, are 46% less likely to use illegal drugs, and 75% more likely to receive a college degree. I am currently in need of financial support to get to Kingsport. Any little bit helps and will be used towards my rental car, hotel, and travel expenses.Thank you for supporting my dream and helping me get to the International Pageant in Kingsport, TN! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPAGLZPINRY

But, I soon came to realize that God had a different plan.   This diagnoses has changed my life permanently.  It took me out of work.  As a two family working household, I had no idea how my family would survive without both incomes.  God knew more about my strength, than I did. So I’m grateful and now know that everyday is an opportunity to try something  new or old that you’ve been putting off.  Every day is a test of will; to be more than my diagnosis.  Everyday is a day for me to bet on myself.  Everyday is a day for me to seek out what I desire; to live fully.  Being in a pageant is a childhood dream, one that I saw often represented by little white girls on T.V.   Being in this pageant, is symbolic of me 'pulling up a seat' at the table and saying, make room for little Black girls.  Being in this pageant gives me an opportunity to own my beauty and represent others who look like me, who live with the struggle of being a Black woman in America.  I'm up to the task.  I will be competing in March 2021 for the title in Chicago!  This is time sensitive as your contribution will help me cover photo shoot cost, travel, hair, makeup, wardrobe and pageant coach. I look forward to representing my hometown of Champaign-Urbana and the great state of Illinois.  Please help me get there by making a donation.

But they’re starting to stress about something called “money”, and they’re really hoping some other humans can help. I mean, I’d gladly accept the normal robot currency of batteries and blades, but my humans reassure me that money is easily traded for these useful things. And I think I can trust them… they’ve been at this a lot longer than I’ve even been alive.In case you don’t know already, I’m a 250 pound “ring spinner” -- that’s right, my ring flies well over 100 mph as I launch myself into whatever bot is brave enough to enter the arena with me!

As you may know I competed in the National American Miss Pageant to become Miss Teen Nevada 2020. Unfortunately, I was not able to take the crown home this year, however did place 2nd runner up. This win allows me to represent Las Vegas as Miss Las Vegas City Queen and compete for the National All American Miss title in Orlando Florda this November. 

As some of you may know I am a full-time online college student at Arizona State University while maintaining employment at Starbucks. For my state pageant this year I worked long hours to be able to save and pay pageant costs on my own,  all while maintaining a 4.0 GPA my senior year of high school. College has proven to require a lot more work and dedication and so does the National pageant. So that I am able to maintain my focus on my college courses while still having time to dedicate to preparations for the pageant I had to reduce my work hours to part time. 

This pageant is something that is very important to me as it is the next big thing on my path towards being able to hold the National All American Miss title  and I will be competing against girls from 49 other states! I love to see my accomplishments throughout my pageant process and to see my parents happy knowing I am making them proud by being in college , working ,competing in  pageants and just staying a busy bee giving them the peace of mind knowing that I am dedicated to anything I put my mind to. 

I'm writing this for my friends and family to ask for donations to help get to my National pageant. I wholeheartedly love competing and unfortunately I can not make it there on my own. Any and all donations are so very appreciated and would help me so much. Thank you all for supporting me and riding along this journey by congratulating me whether it’s on facebook, text messages or even sponsoring me with a monetary donation, I appreciate it so much. 

Much Love, 

Leilani Hughes

“Old theatres are irreplaceable...I think a town’s old theatres are the sanctuary of its dreams.” - Roger EbertOn March 15th the historic Rose Theatre in Port Townsend, WA shut its doors due to the COVID-19 pandemic. There is no re-opening date in sight. There is no additional federal funding. Without help the Rose Theatre will remain closed forever.Why GoFundMe?Since mid-March we have been able to cover fixed expenses with savings, 3 loans, 1 federal grant, 4 movie theater grants, temporary rent abatement, donations, movie streaming, and gift card, membership and popcorn sales. But it's not enough. (Our federal PPP loan application was denied). This GoFundMe goal would sustain us for six months.

Our StoryThe Rose opened in 1907 as a vaudeville house; it has seen the transition from silent film to talkies, and from Technicolor to digital projection. Located in the heart Port Townsend's National Historic District, it serves as one of the major cultural hubs of the Olympic Peninsula, offering a wide variety of independent, classic, foreign and Hollywood films, in addition to simulcasts from New York's Metropolitan Opera, Moscow's Bolshoi Ballet and plays from the National Theatre of London; as well as an annual dance film festival and arts film series. It also serves as the hub for the annual Port Townsend Film Festival.With its three screens, including the intimate Starlight Room, the Rose brings stories from around the globe to its little corner of the world. Every film is personally introduced; you'll find local cider, beer and kombucha on tap, not to mention popcorn with real butter. (More about the Rose here and here and here and here and here ). What Will Donations Be Used For?Funds from this campaign will directly cover fixed monthly expenses - rent, insurance, utilities, phone, internet, accounting, bookkeeping, security, plus wages for three remaining employees. We don't know how long this state-mandated closure will last; our current fundraising goal would cover expenses until February 2021.Why Can't The Rose Open to Partial Audiences?Jefferson County, WA remains in Phase 2 of the state's phased re-opening for businesses. With Phase 3, movie theaters will be allowed to operate, but only at 25% capacity. Between all 3 of our screens, even a ""sell out"" would equal only 69 people. Operating expenses would exceed income. It's a no-win scenario. We cannot open until we can comfortably and safely invite audiences in with at least 50% capacity. We love our community and staff and will only open when it is safe and advisable.  It is very possible that we may not re-open until 2021....But Do Movie Theaters Even Matter Anymore?There are all kinds of ways to experience art, but we believe sometimes you should enjoy it collectively. The Rose is more than just a movie theater: it is a nexus for the Port Townsend community. We have employed nearly 300 local residents since we renovated and re-opened in 1992. We have hosted weddings, lectures, recitals, memorials, concerts and more. Our popcorn is a frequent dinner for the denizens of P.T. - even if they're not seeing the show. Movies today are viewed on screens of all sizes (and you can stream some of ours at home!), but there is a certain movie magic that can only be experienced as the directors/writers/actors/editors intended it - on the big screen and shared with others. We think the Rose still matters, and hope you do too.Other Ways to Help?-Stream movies via www.rosetheatre.com! Not only is there a curated selection of excellent independent fare, updated weekly, but half of every ticket directly supports the theatre. You can stream from anywhere!-Share this campaign with your friends.-We're currently open every Saturday, selling popcorn from 2:00 - 5:00 at 235 Taylor Street, and would love to say hello.Who We AreThe Rose is a family-owned business. In 1992 Rocky Friedman re-opened the darkened cinema after building owner and contractor Phil Johnson did a meticulous restoration. His daughter, who began tearing tickets when she was 12, assists with the business from her home in New York, where she works as an actress. We have a spectacular staff, some of whom have been with us for over 10 years, and all of us thank you from the bottom of our celluloid hearts for your support. What's NextSince we began streaming movies on our website this spring, we've developed a plan to create a fully integrated online film library, with the same thoughtful curation you'll find on our screens, but available to audiences everywhere. We're hoping to provide a seamless viewing experience, with unique film categories and discounts for our members. Stay tuned for updates.Port Townsend is known as ""The City of Dreams"" and by contributing to this fund, you will directly aid in preserving the sanctuary of those dreams.

Jeanise Jones is a Mother(3), Grandmother (6), faithful church member and just an overall great person who will help anyone. She recently emerged as the “STAR” in the new Borat movie. She was recruited from our church the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Oklahoma City after Producers spoke to me about needing a “Black Grandmother” for a small role in a “documentary.” Jeanise emerged as that person and she was completely unaware that this was a comedy, and all of this was made up. We have been praying for the young lady in the movie because we all genuinely thought she was in trouble. The joke is on us/Jeanise and that’s no problem. Many of you have reached from around the world to say thank you, so I thought it would be great to give people a vehicle to say thank you in a tangible way, She wasn’t paid much money at all for her role in this movie.This was not scripted for Jeanise. It all came from the heart. She is one of the most authentic people I’ve ever met. One good thing that has come from this is that Jeanise doesn’t have to worry about “Tutar” anymore. She has WORRIED about this young lady for a year.The movie was scheduled to come out in November, but because of COVID and a rush to release the movie before the election, this movie was released on Amazon instead of theaters.  Please consider saying thank you to Jeanise with a tangible gift. She’s unemployed right now due to Covid. Previously, she worked on a job for 32 years! She’s faithful! Please consider giving a contribution to simply to say thank you to Jeanise for being “A moral compass and a light shining in darkness” in this movie. I would be remiss  if I didn't thank Sacha Cohen Baron and Monica  Levinson (Producer) for casting Jeanise in this movie. Thank you, Reverend Derrick Scobey

It's in their art, it's in their writings, and in our bodies. • ECOSYSTEM/HYBRIDITY: Over time, we’ve established the school in this 3-part ecosystem: an art school, festival, and youth-staffed design firm.○ - School -The school is based on a workshop model designed to teach critical thinking and civic engagement through art making. After answering the questions “What do you love about your community?” and “What do you want to change about your community?” participants address a community issue through art. We start with knowledge of self and love of community.○ - Studio -The Black School: Studio is an art and design firm in which we train youth in paid apprenticeships to execute real-world client work with the long-term intention of self-sustaining programming through earned revenue. This program not only prepares Black and Brown youth for practical, well paying creative careers, but it also equips them with the political consciousness/activist tactics to become change makers. ○ - Festival -Black Love Fest is a free one-day celebration that allows us to publicly share students' artworks back with the community. It includes art exhibits, music performances, installations by professional artists, food, vendors and workshops. The festival demonstrates on a large scale the vision of the world we want to live in, a world centered on Black love. 2 ) Where & WhyFAMILY LEGACYIt’s our own families histories which actually grounds us in this work. Shani’s father taught Black Studies in Michigan for 50 years and has a legacy of hundreds of students who he impacted deeply. After returning to New Orleans from WWII, Joseph’s grandfather, Joseph Cuillier Sr. earned his bachelor's in education from HBCU Xavier University back when the city didn’t even hire Black teachers. Years later in 1989, Lincoln High, previously “Rosenwald"" High, where he taught and became principal, was actually renamed in his honor. HISTORICAL CONTEXTSome of the history we think of the most in terms of building a home for school is the legacy of Booker T. Washington. He emerged from emancipation with the belief that education would be the building blocks for Black folks to construct better lives. With the help of wealthy philanthropist Julius Rosenwald, they built 5,000 Black schoolhouses across the South, always in collaboration with the local communities. Our family history and its direct connection to the legacy of Black school building as a means for self liberation inspires The Black School to move from its current mobile structure to an independent Black institution of its own. We will do this by building a 21st century schoolhouse as a community center serving New Orleans' 7th Ward and surrounding areas. This structure will be complete with workshop spaces, a media lab to house TBS: Studio, a gallery, a reading/meditation room, a kitchen, an artist-in-residence space, and an open access community garden. Imagine being in a school designed by artists, where the school is the artwork and the classrooms feel more like meditation spaces than the prisons so many of our schools are built like today. PARTNERSWe started planning our move from NYC to New Orleans about 4 years ago when we found out we were pregnant with our daughter. We were  already making frequent trips to see family, and the idea to establish our own building flowed from there. We’ve already started programming with Xavier University and we have official plans to partner with the New Orleans African American Museum, the New Orleans Museum of Art, The Community Book Center, and Antenna. We are in contact with many more New Orleans based artists, educators, and organizers, and look forward to establishing a broad network of partnerships as we complete our transition to the City.3 ) What We NeedPHASE 1: For Phase 1, we need to raise the first $60K to purchase land, conduct participatory design workshops with local partners and community members, and produce architectural drawings in collaboration with a New Orleans-based Black architects Bryan C. Lee Jr.  and Whawn Allen ,  and internationally recognized sustainable architecture firm, LOT-EK . We'll use new architectural technologies like modularity and upcycling to build a working prototype for promoting community-built Black radical learning spaces, as well as, low-cost solutions for housing displacement. In the legacy of the Booker T’s schools, we want to publish our building plans to promote the creation of more spaces like ours.PHASE 2:For Phase 2, we need to raise an additional $150K for the permits, fees, building materials, construction.PHASE 3:For Phase 3, we need to raise the last $100k for equipment, early programming, like furniture design workshops, and staffing. In addition to grants and partnerships, revenue from our student staffed design firm and sales from a growing suite of learning tools, merchandise, and art, will sustain our programming beyond the build.CALL TO ACTIONDo you want to be a part of a radical shift in education and support Black institution building? If so, you can help by DONATING and SHARING our campaign with your networks."

This will likely continue beyond the quarantine period, impacting much more than just finances as mental health issues often stem from monetary challenges.Most professional DJ's live gig to gig.

We are calling on our friends and extended family, we need your support. Now is the time for those who appreciate the music to come together and show some love back to the DJ.Utilizing GoFundMe's easy to use platform, we encourage our fans and supporters to donate towards our current goal of $150,000.The amount raised will be disbursed directly to our 200+ pre-selected DJ's in need.

Over the subsequent 12 years, it has become a centerpiece of downtown Alameda and a source of pride for all Alamedans. In addition to reinvigorating business and entertainment in the area, the Theatre has also hosted events and raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for local non-profits, including the Alameda Boys and Girls Club, the Alameda Education Foundation, the Alameda Food Bank, Alameda Hospital, Golden State Warriors Children’s / Community Foundation, and the Tee Shirt league, and dozens of others. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Theatre has been entirely shut down since March. Since then, the ownership has utilized all of the Federal and local government support available to maintain the facility. Those funds are now running out and with no re-opening timeframe being discussed for theatres, it’s time for the community to rally to support this iconic Alameda landmark.Even though the Theatre is closed, bills like utilities, insurance, and basic maintenance do not stop: It takes $25,000 per month just to sustain the business until it can re-open.Please help our beloved Theatre make it through these unprecedented times!Statement from the Conner Family:I moved  my family to this amazing Island City in 2006 to build the Alameda Cineplex and renovate and re-open the landmark Historic Alameda Theatre.  We love living in Alameda and kiss the sky every day.  We have experienced 14 incredible years here and 12 even more incredible years as the operator and care taker of this magical facility we call the Alameda Theatre & Cineplex!  We want to thank every one in Alameda for their support and patronage over the years, these have been great and memorable years.  I recognize clearly that we are care takers of this unique beautiful facility and it will be here when I am gone, my promise and commitment is to pass this historic magical palace on to the next generation better than I found it and better than it is now – Covid or no Covid!  It is the community we serve that makes this such a special place, without the support of the community we would have never been able to get the project done in the first place and certainly would not have enjoyed and celebrated 12 years of delivering the magic of movies and special events to this Island City.  We are temporarily closed now as you all know, Covid-19 has touched every person in the entire world in some way.  We will prevail, and we will re-open stronger than ever!Thank you Alameda, we will see you at the movies soon!

The fire decimated the two small communities of Phoenix and Talent. Many people lost their homes, studios, farms and business. Many in the glass community are displaced with no resources. Including a well known studio in Phoenix called the DoJo. I am a glass artist that goes by the name of LaceFace and I was born and raised here in the Rouge Valley. I am assembling a team to help reach out to anybody in the community that needs help. This includes partnering with Big Country to try and get displaced artists, a place to work and the equipment they need to do so. Our priority will be to make sure people have shelter, water, food, and a way to pay their bills in the immediate future. These resources will not only go to glass artists, but also to anyone in the community who is in need, including collectors, store owners, photographers, farmers and the like.  We all know that the glass community is much bigger than just the artists. It takes many people working together to create the beautiful culture and community we have today. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for supporting our community in this time of need.

Launching careers in music, comedy, and spoken word, the club has been a mainstay in the entertainment industry and has come to be an important part of the fabric that makes Greenwich Village such a vital part of NYC lore and history. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, The Bitter End, like many live venues in NYC, is facing tremendous financial struggle as we try to reopen our doors. We are now reaching out to the world to help us keep this iconic music club alive. We have provided the stage and environment that has helped countless entertainers hone their crafts. From Bob Dylan, Neil Diamond, John Prine and Lady Gaga, to Billy Crystal, George Carlin, and Jon Stewart, we have had countless entertainers begin their careers with us who have then gone on to become great performers and pillars in their fields. Thousands of artists have graced our stage over the past six decades. Nurturing the entertainment community has always been our goal and we hope to continue this tradition and add to this long list of successes.
 
The rich history contained within her walls is unparalleled, and to see the doors shut forever would be a shame and a tragedy. Make no mistake, The Bitter End is still a NYC music Mecca. It’s a place where new and established artists alike nurture, develop, and showcase their acts. It’s a place where top national musicians can hold weekly jams, and where up and coming musicians are discovered. It’s a place where singers, songwriters, comedians, rappers, and poets can enjoy a weekly open mic. It’s a gathering place for NYC’s top working artists to hang out before or after a gig for a drink, as well as watch their colleagues perform. It’s a place where you, music lovers, are invited to witness this magic. It’s a place that has survived decades of change and disaster because it deserved to, and still  deserves to, just as much today as it ever did.
 
We all want to return to a world as close to normal as it was before. A world without the Bitter End just doesn’t seem normal at all to us who have been lucky enough to work here. We hope it doesn’t seem normal to you, either.
 
Most of you have spent the past months giving while you weren’t getting, and it isn't easy to ask for help like this in any circumstance. We do thank you all for contributing to our earlier GoFundMe page that asked to help our dedicated staff. We pray you are able to help out one more time. Please help preserve The Bitter End, a precious treasure of a music landmark that has influenced and contributed to the culture of music and the arts all over the world. We would love nothing more than to continue this long standing tradition.

As is well known, the political revolution in Oromia was sparked and led by the young men and women of the qubee generation, likewise, Kello Media was created and led by a group of dedicated Oromo youth in the diaspora. In a little over a year, we have worked to realize that vision and become an inclusive, pacesetting platform for the people of Oromia and beyond. We have strived to bring our people something new that they will not see on other media platforms while at the same time never compromising on our Oromummaa.It has always been our view that Kello Media will be one of the gifts that the qeerroo of the Qubee generation will leave behind for Oromia and her people. Our people’s reception has been overwhelmingly positive and we have only made it this far due to their consistent and unyielding moral support. We have now been able to begin satellite broadcasts to Oromia, increase our output capacity, improve our technology and build a home-based staff.But just as we have reached this stage, we are now seeing an attack on free media in Oromia, some of which has been directed at us through the Ethiopian government’s propaganda wing on social media. As such, we are taking measures to expand and secure Kello Media to take it into a position that will ensure that our people’s free access to our content cannot be hindered. This involves securing a backup satellite and expanding our staff in Oromia. As this operation is urgent and costly, we are turning to our diaspora community to aid us financially.We are confident that our community will continue in its steadfast and strong support of Kello Media. We are all aware of the dire circumstances freedom of the press and freedom of speech face in Ethiopia today, it is up to all of us to take a stand. Thank you.KELLO TEAM

KreativMndz is the Hip Hop community we admire and serve. The journey for KM started long before it truly began - like a distant dream that playfully teases outstretched fingers. Once the dream was finally seized, the KM entrepreneurs quickly realized just how much sacrifice would be required to keep it alive. As fate would have it, unfortunate circumstances would strike at no fault of KM's, creating a financial ripple that seemed too large to overcome. As time passed, things were starting to take a turn for the better and KM was slowly hitting its stride.Then Covid.Our mission has always been to awaken and guide people to their full potential so that they become the best version of themselves. But like so many other small businesses, KM was left devastated by this pandemic which abruptly halted the caliber of our existence. Though we tried shifting our business model to online classes and driving on-demand content, we have not been able to meet the financial demands of mounting expenses like rent and debt. We want to continue to provide a creative outlet for our dancers to express their emotions - ESPECIALLY now. We want to provide a platform for choreographers to paint their artistic talents. We want to continue to contribute to the Hip Hop community we celebrate with every piece of choreography and every syncopated beat of music. Additionally, despite these difficult times, we have continued to dedicate our time and resources to raising funds for worthy causes like meals for essential workers, meals for dancers, mental awareness charities, and Dancers Unite for Black Lives.

COVID19 CAN'T CANCEL CHRISTMAS!!!COVID 19 has kept us apart since March.  As we look towards the holiday season, many of the things that we count on to mark its beginning have already been cancelled.  This can have a devastating effect on all of us - especially for those of us who have celebrated Christmas At The Old Church together for 30 years.  The truth is that I am already missing seeing all of you!How You Can Help Make Some Good NewsNow I need your help.  As you know, filming a television show is costly.  We need to hire a film crew, producers, editors, decorators, costume designers and, of course, pay our talented artists.  Then there is advertising, marketing , social media and sponsors. Help me fund this project and make good news for Portland!HOW SOON DO WE NEED THE FUNDS?  ASAP!!!We start filming on Oct. 3rd and then the editing process begins, search for sponsors, planning and purchasing advertising, marketing and social media etc...YOUR SUPPORTWe can't do this project without funding it's a whole different situation than selling tickets for a live show and every dollar counts. Your support  will help myself and fellow artists make a living this holiday season for as you know all of us gig workers are unemployed and it will be at least another 12 to 18 months before we will be able to have regular live concerts. YOUR GENEROSITY Will mean so much to me, my cast and all of the people who have made this show their holiday tradition for the last 30 years. Christmas At The Old Church is all about feeling something special together with our  families, friends and loved ones and I know how important it is to keep those deep connections and feelings alive!GO FUND ME...When you support this Go Fund Me, you are giving a gift to the entire community who will now be able to see Christmas At The Old Church for FREE! It’s so important to keep traditions alive as best we can as we get through this pandemic.  It gives us hope and inspiration.  We have shared so many precious moments over the years.

Check out our store athttps://ark-lodge-cinemas.myshopify.com/collections/all Our StoryThe Ark Lodge building was built by local Masons in 1921. They sold it in 2001 and in 2005 the upstairs Altar Room was converted into a movie theater. Two additional screens on the main floor were added followed by the fourth screen which debuted in 2014. Located in the heart of Columbia City’s National Historic District, it serves as one of the major cultural hubs and the only neighborhood theater, offering a wide variety of independent, classic, foreign, and Hollywood films, in addition to simulcasts broadcasts. With its four screens, including the intimate lounge upstairs, the Ark brings stories from around the globe to its little corner of the world. You will find a local flavor, a relaxed vibe, and friendly staff.   A movement to restore the vitality of one of our oldest Seattle neighborhoods known for its love of arts and culture, and entertaining nightlife; from cinema and theater to local galleries and life-size wall murals, a community full of art is a community full of culture. Research has even shown that cities that emphasize art have more civic and social engagement, better child welfare and even lower poverty rates. Stimulating Business. Arts organizations stimulate business and economic growth in a community.https://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/movies/seattles-ark-lodge-cinemas-launches-gofundme-campaign-hoping-to-tap-into-support-shown-for-other-local-indie-theaters/ Columbia City is one of eight Landmark Districts located in the City of Seattle. It was designated a landmark district in 1978 and was also placed on the National Register of Historic Districts that same year.(source: https://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/programs-and-services/historic-preservation/historic-districts/columbia-city-landmark-district ). Due to the closure forced by the Pandemic we want to take the time given to us to be more inclusive to all our neighbors by adding much needed ADA accessibility features, upgrades to the seating and a beautiful marquee to add a vibrancy to the historic Masonic Ark Lodge building. We need your help to make this dream a reality.Why GoFundMe?https://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/movies/when-theaters-reopen-will-people-return-seattle-moviehouse-operators-wrestle-with-the-unknown/ Since mid-March we have been able to cover fixed expenses with savings, and creative budgeting. We want to reopen our doors at the end of this Pandemic and reveal a new look, a more inclusive theater, a gathering space for families and an “after dark” club atmosphere to indulge in arts, cinema, music, wine, and petite entrees. Truly a “SYMPHONY FOR YOUR SENSES”  This GoFundMe goal would not only sustain us to have our staff return to work, but also allow for the upgrades that we are in need of to make the space more functional and inviting. Our auspicious goal is to one day own the property to ensure that we will always have a movie and arts venue right here in Columbia City. What Will Donations Be Used For?Funds from this campaign will directly cover the renovation of the theater; adding much needed ADA accessible features, a beautiful, vibrant, and welcoming marquee to bring a renewed feel to the historic building and new seating. It will also allow us to catch up on some of our fixed expenses while the theater has been closed since Mid-March. Why Can't the Ark Lodge Cinema Open to Partial Audiences?King County, WA remains in Phase 2 of the state's phased re-opening for businesses. With Phase 3, movie theaters will be allowed to operate, but only at 25% capacity. Operating expenses would exceed income. It is a no-win scenario. We cannot open until we can comfortably and safely invite audiences back. We love our community and staff and will only open when it is safe and advisable.  It is very possible that we will not reopen until the fall of 2021. In the meantime, though, this allows us to do the renovations, the upgrades and prepare to reopen our doors safely with a brand-new look. But Do Movie Theaters Even Matter Anymore?There are all kinds of ways to experience art, but we believe sometimes you should enjoy it collectively. The Ark Lodge Cinema is more than just a movie theater: it is a hub for the arts in this community. We have employed local residents since our opening. We continue to add new features to attract a more diverse population. With the upcoming renovation we will be adding a wine and beer bar, a small catering kitchen to serve petite entrees, tapas, and appetizers. We will have private events, live music “after dark.” Our goal is to provide you a gathering place; a place away from home where you come to meet with friends and mix and mingle with neighbors. Movies today are viewed on screens of all sizes (and you can stream some of ours at home!), but there is a certain movie magic that can only be experienced as the directors/writers/actors/editors intended it - on the big screen and shared with others. We think the Ark Lodge Cinema still matters and hope you do too.Other Ways to Help?Sponsorship opportunities for you to take advantage of!  Many levels available.

It’s happening <3As planned: The remaining funds will be used towards the investment in housing outside of the city for some, while others have decided that new prospects for employment and their creative practice ties them to locate housing in NYC. We understand that this has pivoted from the collective purchase, and believe that this shift will permit the access each AIR has been working towards the last few months to pursue their social, personal, and professional goals on their own terms.We are on the search for appropriate subsidized housing that will allow AIRs to have a sustainable accommodation for the long-term!!Moving Forward: We intend to keep the GoFundMe open for the remainder of the year to hopefully reach our intended 60K goal! Please continue to amplify and donate towards our cause to provide holistic assistance and mutual aid this group, and their communities! We’ve made this gmail: [email redacted]To hear from you, communicate about next steps, stay connected about our developments as we actualize our futures!

What started as a project to offer refuge for protesters quickly shifted to a mutual aid space for those facing houselessness. After securing temporary housing for the AIRs, it soon became apparent that the five artists needed a more permanent solution.People’s Space and Performance Space are now helping the AIRs raise funds to collectively purchase a home outside of NYC, and to provide seed funding for their artistic careers. With your support, the AIRs will be able to secure both long-term housing for themselves and eventually other houseless, Black and trans artists.Help us raise $60,000 by October 20 to lift up impacted communities and most of all, help keep them safe, sustained and supported!The donation will not go to Performance Space; 100% of the proceeds will go directly to the AIRs.

This was also a vehicle to secure a future for my family and me as well as to continue to honor my mentor's legacy, Mr. Randy Hien of The Living Room. I am not comfortable asking for help in raising funds for a down payment, but it is our only option.  So many amazing artists and musicians have reached out to me to ask how they can help.  I know in these trying times that funds are tight - all of your support and generosity are truly appreciated.”

The Trumpet is My Weapon Gun Exchange Program is raising money to purchase trumpets which are about $250 each and music books to exchange for guns from New Orleans youth. On Monday, July 13, 2020, a group of children were shot and injured while playing outside their home, with one of the kids, a 9-year-old male, being murdered.  As the father of a 9 year old son, I thought how easy it could have been for that to be my own son.  Much like a lot of the gun violence happening in my city by young people, it is heartbreaking to know and see this happening to our kids.  My thoughts and actions immediately went to how can I contribute to reducing the chances of the continuation of this level of gun violence amongst our youth. 

So I opened Instagram and posted  “To all youth in New Orleans, Bring me a gun and I’ll give you a trumpet.  No questions asked!”Once kids started reaching out with guns I realized I would be able to get a few guns off the street.   A lot of people reached out to see how they can help, that’s where this fundraiser comes in.  The more instruments we have the more guns we can collect.  Once guns are collected they will be turned over to New Orleans Police Department and dismantled.    As a child, and adolescent who grew up in the Lower 9th Ward of New Orleans, I have experienced and engaged in things that individuals at that age should not have to endure.  What saved me and redirected my path was a trumpet, the music, and culture of the city that it connected me with.  It showed me that success, connections, and differences can be managed through self-expression.  When I needed money to take care of myself, I played my horn in the French Quarters for tips and eventually that grew into a full on music career traveling the world.  If I became upset I expressed that through song.  The trumpet became a weapon that really saved my life, so I figured it may be able to have the same impact for another young person from New Orleans. The Trumpet Is My Weapon is a mantra that I have used over the years.  I began using that mantra because the trumpet really became my weapon and tool for my success.  It has opened doors and sent me places that as a kid from the Lower 9th Ward,  statistics say I should have never been.  The goal of The Trumpet Is My Weapon Campaign and Gun Exchange Program is to put trumpets, and eventually other instruments, in the hands of our kids so that they can use it as their weapon and tool for success while taking guns off the street at the same time.  With a communal effort we can make a difference in the lives of others.  Even one life saved is a step in the right direction.Proceeds  from “Trumpet is my weapon” merchandise at TrueOrleans.com will used to offset costfor Trumpet is my Weapon programs

Can you contribute to help us raise our finishing funds? We need between $144,000 and $160,000 to get to the finish line.Why does this matter?Before an explosive global uprising condemned the murder of George Floyd, there was a small town in Missouri that erupted in protest after the murder of Mike Brown Jr. As it was in Ferguson, so it has been again around the world: tanks in the streets, tear gas and rubber bullets fired at peaceful protesters, storefronts engulfed in flames, and everywhere the clear and courageous voices of people who can no longer tolerate the scourges of racism and police brutality. The scale of the uprising has grown, but the broken heart and defiant soul of the movement is the same. What can the world learn from a protest like this? And how can we begin to come together to create a new world in its aftermath?These difficult but important questions are explored in our paradigm-shifting, documentary film Ferguson Rises. Beyond the media sensationalism and simplistic narratives, Ferguson Rises presents diverse perspectives from a sometimes uneasy mix of people in Ferguson, a microcosm of the United States. The lessons of Ferguson are more than just lessons around organizing and civil rights; they are lessons in building community and finding hope in the face of tragedy. These lessons can be instructive to this nation as it attempts to remedy and heal the deep divisions that stand in the way of our recognizing each other’s humanity. What happened to Mike Brown Jr. happened to George Floyd, to Breonna Taylor, and happens every 28 hours to another African American at the hands of police, security guards, and vigilantes. More ""Fergusons"" will continue to happen unless we all stand up and do something to end the underlying conditions of racism and injustice that cause this. As we march and pass legislation, let’s not forget the power of film to keep the message of justice alive, long after the streets are cleared. Support Ferguson Rises in being that film and that voice!What your contribution goes towards:Your contribution will be directly used to pay our team to get this project done.

Juice has been independently publishing and keeping it punk for 26 years. Please help keep Juice alive – keep the voice of the people alive and independence alive.” – Jim Murphy, Juice Magazine Skate EditorThis is Shannon Smith, aka sk8mom, from Charleston, SC, with a call to kick down: Juice Magazine has always stayed true to our culture – constantly giving back and supporting our scene and skate family. They have been instrumental in communicating our culture in an honest way and have never been compromised or sold out. To our great advantage, they have always found a way to get the information, inspiration and stoke to us come hell or high water. Now they could use a little back up, so please donate…Our friend, Terri Craft, started Juice Magazine with $500 and a dream, and it has become an ongoing experiment of how the independent spirit can thrive and survive. Juice's commitment to our community has let us all enjoy the results of their passion, along with the help of the talented and dedicated contributors, advertisers, subscribers, editors, writers, photographers, designers, skate shops, surf shops, music stores, friends and family, which are the backbone of Juice. As they were on the way to printing their upcoming edition of Juice Magazine, they were hit by the effects of the suspension of business due to the coronavirus pandemic, now they are in a FINANCIAL CRISIS and need your assistance. The economic limitations imposed by this unexpected pandemic could crush their dreams and our core source of connecting with our surf/skate/music family.Please check out the following accolades, write ups, and straight facts of their ongoing work and how much has been achieved in our scene over these past 26 years. All of these successes and achievements have happened because of their work to honor us all. You know what you gotta do - so thanks in advance and keep rollin.Shannon =============https://youtu.be/wBZvJEIe51o=============NOTE FROM TERRI CRAFT - JUICE MAGAZINE OWNER/PUBLISHER/EDITOR=============""When I started Juice Magazine 26 years ago, you could count the number of skateparks on one hand and now there are thousands of skateparks all over the world. Two and a half decades ago, skateboarding related charities were non-existent. Today, there are numerous non-profits giving back to skateboarding in many vital ways. One of the most important differences between now and then is that, 26 years ago, there was a clear division between old school and new school skateboarding. Now that wall of separation has followed the same path as the Berlin Wall, allowing for an unprecedented unification of skateboarders all over the globe. Great strides have been made for girls that skate as well as the acceptance of skate history and long overdue recognition for skateboarding’s pioneers and its artifacts. At the same time, the current generation of skateboarders is taking skateboarding to new heights, previously unimaginable. Skateboarding is as diverse as the skateboarders that are addicted to it and the state of skate is strong. It has been the greatest honor to be part of the skate, surf, art and music family over the last quarter of a century and I just want to thank you all for the opportunity and for all of your support. I know these times are rough for everyone, so please know how much I believe in you. I hope you are staying safe and well out there and thank you for caring, sharing and contributing! Peace, love and respect always...============NOTE FROM DAN LEVY – JUICE MAGAZINE ASSISTANT EDITOR AND MARKETING DIRECTOR============Terri Craft has been at the helm of Juice Magazine since founding it in 1993 and she has not wavered in her pursuit to preserve the cultural significance of our beloved arts through the ancient archiving format of talk story. Her unbelievable passion to keep Juice Magazine alive for over two and a half decades with no major investment is a testament to her all-in attitude and uncompromising loyalty to documenting skateboarding/music/art and surfing. Juice Magazine is more than paper and ink. It is a beacon of authenticity to skaters, musicians, artists and surfers all over the world. Over the years, Juice has grown into more than just a print magazine, and Terri, with her DIY attitude, figured it out by learning how to build a website, make merchandise, throw events, raise money for charities, help get skateparks built in NYC and Venice Beach and more, all while putting others before herself to keep the celebration of our culture alive. Terri is not one to ask for this type of help, however, after all she has done for all of us, we are asking for your assistance on her behalf. With your help, Juice Magazine will remain an independent voice, shining the light on those who deserve it, while remaining a forum of open and honest communication for us to share our love for skateboarding, music, art and surfing worldwide. Skateboarding is the family we choose and when you have family you can get through anything. Juice Magazine now needs your help to keep music, surf, skate, art journalism and advocacy alive during this difficult time. The COVID-19 virus shuttered the Venice Beach Skatepark as well as live music and cultural events here in Venice: including many of our music venues, bars and restaurants; festivals and concerts; art shows and skateboarding events. The virus has also temporarily suspended events at our Venice Beach based location and our print edition of Juice Magazine is temporarily on hold until Barnes & Noble resumes accepting shipments of magazines, so our ability to stay alive is threatened.  Your donation will help us to keep Juice Magazine up and running and help to keep our skateboarding, surfing, art, music advocacy alive and strong. Please consider a donation, and thank you most gratefully!============QUOTES ABOUT JUICE...============Here are just a few words of kindness and encouragement that have kept us going over the years…“JUICE has the Juice. More than a magazine. A community of humans that do it! Juice is BADASS!!!” – CHUCK DUKOWSKI""Juice Magazine has been a voice for core skateboarding, music, and art for over 25 years. They did their first feature on me in 1998, and we’ve worked together many times over the years. Running a print mag is always a tough business for love, not money, but is especially challenging during a pandemic. Juice is in financial distress, and I want to help and pay my proper respects to style in skateboarding, but also paying my respects to authentic voices in skateboard culture who chronicle the past and the future. I will be releasing art soon with proceeds to help Juice stay in business, but for now, they have a GoFundMe and you can support to keep them in print. Thanks for caring!” – SHEPARD FAIREY“JUICE is the truest mag out there period.” – TIM JACKSON“Please contribute to help keep Juice Magazine alive! In this information age where stories and pictures are not much more than a blip on a screen, there’s something special about having a magazine in your hand, reading the words printed on paper, and giving the info time to sink in. Juice has never sold out and it has truly made an art form of documenting the history of hard-core music, skating, surfing, park building, art, and the outside of the box lifestyle that our culture and community is formed from. The people behind Juice have dedicated their lives to bringing you this important information and should be supported like the family that they are. Thanks.” – GRINDLINE SKATEPARKS""I can’t believe how great the interviews are in your mag. It’s like the Surfer’s Journal of skateboard culture. Thanks.” – GREG ESCALANTE“You’re doing a good job with Juice. It reminds me of the early days of Thrasher.” – FAUSTO VITELLO“Juice Magazine is the best, the most authentic with the most integrity for 26 years. Always supporting skateboarding, now they need our support. Do whatever you can do in this difficult time, because that’s how skateboarding has always worked at its core, grass roots. Please donate.” – NYC SKATE COALITION“Juice is the best skateboarding magazine I’ve ever seen and I’ve seen them all.” – JIM BARNUM – SPECTRUM SKATEPARKS“Juice is family, not just a magazine or a place to crash in Venice. Juice is the backbone of skateboarding and it tells the stories of its history without a corporate infuriating of business politics. Keep it punk and true my friends. I love you guys.” – BILL DANFORTH“Juice Magazine has done so much for skateboarding, keeping the core of it alive, and now it is time for us to stand up and help our skateboard brothers and sisters. We must make sure this magazine stays out there and show our appreciation for their dedication to skateboarding. Even if it's just a dollar, it will all add up. Everything begins with one step, so do what you can, like they've always done for skateboarding and I thank all of you on behalf of Juice Magazine for your support.” – JESSE MARTINEZ“Good job people! Finally a mag that doesn’t just ooze industry/corporate sleaze from every page. Good idea to interview people who build and do stuff rather than just the new flavor of the week shoe pro.” – RED “Everyone has the same opinion of your mag it's the best damn mag anywhere!” – STEVE HERRING“We at Made In Venice Movie believe in community, as do our friends at Juice Magazine. They have kept their mag going for 26 years independently and now they need our community to come together and help. Please donate to them if you have the ability.

Been reading it for days and still haven't gotten thru all the killer interviews!!! Keep up the good fight!!!” – BACKDOOR SKATE SHOP“As many of you know, Juice Magazine has been an incredibly important voice in the worlds of skating, surfing, art, and music over the last 26 years. They’re also great people and a very vital part of our community and culture here in Venice. Like many of us, they’ve been hit pretty hard by the covid-19 crisis and they need our help right now. If you can chip in, let’s show our friends some love!” - BRIAN AVERILL“Pools, Pipes and Punk Rock. Terri and Dan of Juice Magazine have been my family for the past 15 years. I’ve witnessed first hand their unrelenting dedication to the skate, music, art and surf world. They are a pilLar to this community, ALWAYS giving. I know personally, that they live and breath, giving every single part of their existence, selflessly, to this community. I’ve seen them hit really hard times, when life might be easier to just throw in the towel, but they’ve never given up and they still keep giving back. Their intention behind it is 100 pure and old school and NOTHING less. I know most of us are hitting hard times ourselves, but if you feel any connection to this, and have a lil extra to help out, please do. We need to keep this magazine alive. When so much is changing in the world, not even talking about Covid, but technology and the internet is taking over, it feels good to hold this printed magazine in your hands, read thru the interviews and look at bitching photos. Next time you read an issue of Juice, know that there are a LOT of blood, sweat and tears that go into it. A whole lotta LOVE, too. I’ve honestly never known anyone as dedicated to something as these two. Terri started this mag 26 years ago and she’s given everything she’s got to it. Literally everything. Let’s keep JUICE alive!! Help if you can. Thanks!” – KAIT NADINE“Another great issue! I read the thing cover to cover to cover to cover and it will still take me a few months to fully absorb the thing. I know y'all go through hell trying to get each issue out but no other rag comes even close!!! Kill photos! The interviews are unreal. The Best Mag in the world. You guys rule the pool!!!!” - MERK“Juice is a crucial contemporary and historical source for the whole skate/surf/punk rock/art scene worldwide and founded, owned and edited by Terri Craft along with the multitalented Dan Levy. They are based in Venice Beach and create Juice with a totally independent spirit and approach to living life with an artistic integrity that is hard to maintain these days.” – DOUG MENUEZ“Juice is a lifesaver for me – the super long interviews and sheer amount of information in Juice has got me through many a long subway commute here in Japan. Cheers mate! Kind Regards.” – ROBERT – JAPAN“Juice Magazine has always been a pillar of support for our community of surfers and skaters. When someone needed help, they were their voice. Now they need our help. Any amount will hep to keep them going another 26 years strong."" – KELLY BARNES""Our community in venice is very tight.we need to take care of those that have taken care of us.

Dependably awesome work. I have just gotten through the first cover to cover read of the last issue and I must say again that it will be well reviewed until I can scope the next. I just can’t get enough. Thanks again for making real skateboarding information available. You never fail to leave me speechless. You are the truth, the life and the hopeless skate-addicts lifeline to Utopia. Thanks again.” – BARRY STRACHAN – AUSTRALIA""Juice Magazine is arguably the very heart and soul of Venice, California. They have been documenting the skate, surf, and music scenes around the world since 1993, and a lot of the town's cool can be easily traced back to Juice. Publisher/Editor/Owner, Terri Craft, and Assistant Editor, Dan Levy, have been bringing everyone the Juice for over 26 years, and now it's time to return the favor... Juice Magazine is pretty much the Bible to so many in the skate world, not only in Venice, but around the world ... Venice just gets to call them our own. So many awesome times have originated with Juice ... from skate contests to ragers at the Juice headquarters, from epic art exhibitions like Beyond The Streets to little art shows in local galleries. From collaborations with the California Locos and Shepard Fairey (and a new print for Juice is coming very soon by Fairey in another effort to fundraise - how cool!) to showcasing the work of local and coming up artists - and bands and writers and everyone who gets and appreciates the Juice vibe... They were fundamental in helping to get the Venice Skatepark built, as well as getting the documentary about it made - Made In Venice is crucial viewing for anyone who cares about skating and/or Venice. We have already lost so much from this awful virus, don't let it happen to one of the very best things about Venice/the skate/surf/art/music world. I miss being in Venice so much right now, and the Juice family is one of the things I miss the very most. PLEASE let it still be there when I get back. PLEASE let us now have their back. One more time, you may donate HERE. THANK YOU SO MUCH for helping to bring so many more awesome times to us all! You're awesome too. LONG LIVE JUICE!"" – CJ GRONNER - BLOGTOWN================JUICE HISTORY================Juice Magazine is dedicated to documenting the heart and soul of skateboarding, surfing, music, art and culture. Through its print magazine, website, social media, skate contests, music events, art shows, Dogtown Chronicles, Alva Collection, Duty Now For the Future Series, Bones Brigade Chronicles, Mid-Atlantic Sound Surf & Skate Symposiums, Juice Surf Skate Culture Collection Shows, Five and Alive at Riverside, Venice Skatepark Contests, Guinness World Record Wall Ride, Juice Drop In Shows, Juice Live, Venice Skateboard Culture Experiences, fundraisers for charities and skateboarding events, and its commitment to help get a skatepark built in Venice, California and raise funds for Andy Kessler’s 108 Riverside Skatepark in New York City, NY, Juice has endeavored to support the surf/skate/music community worldwide for over a quarter of a century. In 1993, in Wilmington, North Carolina, the first issue of Juice Magazine was created with a $500 start-up family loan. After receiving a Bachelor of Science in Marketing from UNC-Wilmington, Terri Craft saw the need for a magazine with extensive coverage of the burgeoning music, skate and surf scene. The music, surf, and skate combination soon grabbed hold of the marketplace and the Juice presence was established. After write-ups in Rolling Stone, Men’s Journal, Thrasher, TransWorld Business, TransWorld Skateboarding and Entrepreneur, Craft was even more encouraged to pursue her dream. From the start, Juice has focused on unique content, and discovering unsung talent in the music, skate, art and surf communities while paying respect to its pioneers and innovators. With street teams spreading the word, Juice firmly ensconced itself as an essential periodical for the surf/skate/music audience and expanded its distribution to the entire East Coast. In addition, Juice launched the first Juice compilation CD, in 1995, and participated in numerous trade shows including SxSW, Surf Expo, Magic, and the CMJ Music Marathon, as well as the debut of the Warped Tour.In June 1996, Juice created its first annual music and sports conference, the Mid-Atlantic Sound Surf and Skate Symposium. M.A.S.S.S ‘96 included over 100 bands, 30 pro skateboarders, an independent film festival, music seminars, and interactive Internet broadcasting by SonicNet, which attracted top music industry executives and over 7,000 attendees.  In July of 1996, Juice Magazine launched a second Juice office in New York City, and immediately attracted over 80 freelancers nationwide. As a direct result, Juice strengthened its editorial voice and established new relationships with national advertisers. After expanding distribution, Juice witnessed immediate response as the national ad ratio increased from 20 to 50 percent. Juice also dove into one of the most challenging markets, New York City, and successfully progressed from a regional to a national publication with retailers across the country in 41 states, as skate legends, Jim Murphy and Andy Kessler, joined the Juice team as Skate Editors.In 1997, Juice hosted the second annual M.A.S.S.S. showcasing 175 bands, skateboarding demos, a fashion awards show, recording industry mentor sessions, surfing contests, a VW smash-up and dune buggy show and an additional outdoor stage. The Juice skateboarding street course and Juice vert ramp featured professional skateboarder Tony Hawk as well as over 40 other pro skaters.  As a result, attendance at M.A.S.S.S. 1997 sailed over the 10,000 mark. Sponsors, Pepsi-Cola, Miller Brewing and Eastern Skateboard Supply were extremely pleased, as was the community, as millions of dollars in hotel and restaurant revenues poured in for the week long event. In NYC, Dan Levy joined Juice as Assistant Editor and Ad Sales Director bringing expertise as a skateboarder and skatepark owner to the team.In 1998, planning began for Urban Phenomenon, a monumental music concert and skateboarding event, which took place at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, site of the 1932 and 1984 Summer Olympics. Juice was chosen to organize the skateboarding for this landmark occasion, gathering together over 110 of the world’s best pro skateboarders. The concert featured Run-DMC, Brand Nubian, 808 State and Mix Master Mike as well as the Red Bull vert ramp and became a launching ground for the Tony Hawk Pro Skater Video Game. In September 1999, Juice Magazine expanded once again with a new office in the heart of multi-cultural and creative Venice, California, in order to more fully capture the advertising base on the West Coast. Due to this expansion, without additional staffing, the publishing schedule was modified from eight to four issues per year in order to continue to make the best magazine every time. Juice also stepped in to champion the fight for a public skatepark in Venice, developing relationships with the City of Los Angeles and working to strengthen bonds in the local community. In June 2000, Juice began its foray into documentary filmmaking with a 7-day excursion to Hawaii with skate and surf legends including Tony Alva, to capture footage for “Along For the Ride.” At the same time, a dynamic line up of surf and skate legends joined the Juice editorial crew, including: Steve Olson, Jay Adams, Christian Hosoi, Jeff Ho, Herbie Fletcher and Dibi Fletcher.After seven years of being a free publication, Juice made the transition to a paid circulation in December 2000 with an introductory cover price of $2.00. In February 2002, Juice was picked up for newsstand distribution by one of the largest magazine distributors in the country, servicing over 9,500 locations, including Barnes & Noble and Borders. Juice then began distribution with a specialty distributor for independent book and music stores at $3.99 cover price. Skate legend, Dave Duncan, also joined Juice in 2002.In 2004, Juice invested in an extensive website and began to build its social media audience across multiple platforms. Juice began to increase international distribution in Germany, Japan and France. Juice also presented the first ever Guinness World Record Wall Ride Contest for skateboarding at Hollywood + Highland, in Los Angeles, California.In 2008, circulation was adjusted from 30,000 to 25,000, after the closing of Borders, and the Juice print publishing schedule and advertising rates were reconfigured in reaction to the economic recession hitting the country. In response to this reality, Juice introduced consulting, public relations, event planning and social media services to its repertoire. In October 2009, the Venice Skatepark officially opened in Venice, California, an astonishing victory at the end of a long fight to make the skatepark a reality. Juice helped to organize the Skatepark Grand Opening with the City of Los Angeles, and began hosting frequent skateboarding events and contests. In 2010, Juice launched its event series, the Juice Magazine Surf Skate Culture Collection, featuring contemporary and vintage skateboard collections, photography and artwork, transforming the Juice office into a skate/surf/music/art exhibition space. These cultural events also served as fundraisers for Venice locals and non-profits in need of support. In 2011, Juice began an exclusive collaboration with award-winning filmmaker, Stacy Peralta, providing behind the scenes documentation of “Bones Brigade: An Autobiography”, from its first days of filming to its debut at the Sundance Film Festival. Through this exciting partnership, Powell Peralta became one of Juice Magazine’s biggest advertisers, in print and online. In 2012, Juice Sk8Tracks, a digital sampler of punk rock music, was launched to introduce new bands as well as current releases from punk rock legends including Jello Biafra, Wayne Kramer, Fishbone & Meat Puppets.In 2014, Juice developed a collaborative relationship with an artistic conclave called the California Locos: John Van Hamersveld, Norton Wisdom, Dave Tourje, Gary Wong, Chaz Bojorquez, Shepard Fairey, Mister Cartoon, Estevan Oriol, RETNA, SLICK and Robert Williams. This project resulted in a variety of events, video projects, books and art shows.In 2015, Juice launched an online video interview series called “In The Van” in collaboration with revered punk rockers, The Loud Ones. The series finale was celebrated with a Loud Ones concert at Juice headquarters in Venice, California.Juice expanded its outreach into radio in 2016 through a project with Steve Jones of the Sex Pistols, and KLOS 95.5 FM’s Jonesy’s Jukebox Show at the L.A. Times Festival of Books featuring Juice editor and surf/skate icon, Jeff Ho.In 2016, Juice launched its own TV channel on Roku introducing Juice TV to viewers worldwide through a partnership with Barons Media. Juice TV features surf, skate, music and art shows and short films, as well as its “In The Van” series.In the summer of 2016, Juice partnered with internationally-released documentary, “Made In Venice”, featuring the story of the fight to get the Venice Skatepark built. While providing publicity services and social media campaigns, Juice also participated in multiple sold out premieres with the film’s Producer, Dianne Lerner, and distributor, Abramorama.In 2017, Juice was thrilled to work with Shepard Fairey, Glen E. Friedman and Jeff Ho for a behind the scenes video to inform the surf/skate/music/art audience about a special collaboration print featuring the godfather of Dogtown surf & skate. Once the print launched online, it sold out in less than three seconds, one of the fastest selling prints of all time.2018 also saw a vast expansion of the Juice Live Shows on JuiceMagazine.com, including Juice “Drop In” interview shows filmed live from the Juice offices in Venice. The Juice Live Webcam, which offers a 24 Hour A Day live feed from the Venice Beach boardwalk, one of the biggest tourist attractions in America with over 30,000 visitors daily, saw continued growth in 2018. In another expansion of Juice brand awareness, AirBNB Experiences selected Juice Assistant Editor, Dan Levy, to host a rare insider look at Juice world headquarters in Venice with his Dogtown Cultural History tour, which includes a behind the scenes look at the Venice Skatepark and brings international visitors to Juice offices daily. In 2018, Juice partnered with Adidas for Beyond the Streets, the definitive showcase of street and graffiti art in 40,000+ square feet of immersive exhibits celebrating skate, graffiti and music in Los Angeles for a four-month exhibit and sold out shows.In 2019, Juice joined forces with Robert Trujillo to present OTTTO, featuring Tye Trujillo, Brian Ferretti and Jonah Abraham, at the Juice 25 Year Anniversary in Venice Beach sponsored by Vans. In 2019, Juice collaborated with Vans and provided a set location for the Tony Alva Story movie with actor, Josh Brolin. Juice also hosted the Tony Alva movie premiere at the Santa Monica International Film Festival. 2019 also saw Skull Skates launch a Juice collaboration with limited edition skateboards and apparel celebrating Juice 25 Years and Skull Skates 40th year.In 2020, Juice continues to add to its client list, with the addition of The Waterfront Venice and The Winston House, two of the most popular hotspots in Venice Beach, California, and was in the process of planning a series of skateboarding contests and music events in California and beyond, when the coronavirus hit... ===========COMMUNITY & PHILANTHROPY: ===========Juice has always believed in giving back.

ABOUT THE GALAXY FUNDFrom nothing to something, a prototype fund focused on the earliest stage of development. Sometimes the initial barriers are the hardest to overcome.  My name is Evva Karr and as the founder and final boss of GLITCH, I’ve heard it all before when launching projects like HyperDot  and Power Leveling   -- “it’s too risky,” “the market is unproven,” or “talk to us when you’re closer to launch.” There’s always an excuse and most people aren’t interested in financing bold new ideas and early stage experiments -- especially from BIPOC, women, and queer founders. Equity begins at the foundership level and the Galaxy Fund has been created to address this financing gap for BIPOC, women, and queer-led studios. Starting right now with a $50,000 raise for a fierce group of five Black women and queer founders. The funding will be given as an unrestricted prototype grant for each founder to use however they see fit for themselves and their business -- child care, hardware, software, part-time staff, coaching, legal, therapy. Let’s fund the next prototypes for these exceptional artists and wait at the edge of our seats for the groundbreaking worlds they will build and share with us.I’ll be personally matching up to $10,000 and encourage those who can do the same to reach out to me and pledge as well. If we reach our goal, then we’ll add more Black women and queer founders to this campaign and keep going. Let’s make this happen y’all. THE FOUNDERSDaisy Ein Daisy Ein is the co-owner and founder of Super Retro Duck. A jack-of-all trades, Daisy leads as a visual artist, musician, and developer.

We are raising $71,000 to save Surflight in their 71st season. 

Devastation hits the nonprofit Surflight Theater hard for the second time this summer. First it was the Coronavirus then it was Tropical Storm Isaias. A successful inventive outdoor season was well underway with the musical Cabaret just having closed, many Children's Theatre shows having played, Frozen Jr and Mamma Mia about to open. The gale force winds did them in by destroying their outdoor tent, collapsing entirely the venue, stage, props and the electrics light and sound equipment. Everyone is safe which is most important. Please pray that they get through this terrible year, and get back on their feet as soon as possible!! They are hoping to be back up and running this week. Remember, through all of this turmoil, their bills aren't going to stop while the plays and shows do and equipment gets replaced. Insurance will help some but not enough. Please make a donation to help keep them afloat and help them to return better and stronger!!. Any size donation would be appreciated. What you think might be an amount too small and won't make a difference to them, is totally incorrect. Remember, every little bit counts!More information about Ocean Professional Theatre Co: The Mission of Ocean Professional Theatre Company (dba Surflight Theatre) is to provide first quality professional theatre for the residents of and visitors to Southern New Jersey while providing a training ground for the next generations of theatre artists.

Monthly expenses are high because we aren’t just a restaurant or just a music/event venue, but both.  Therefore, our costs are high to cover the basic expenses of the unique nature of GCA.  We will not reopen until it is clearly safe to do so. We will not jeopardize the health of our staff or our community.  Opening part way is not financially viable.So we are asking for your help.  Our goal is $70,000 to remain viable for 6-7 months.  Our hope is by then it will be safe and the world will be in a much better place.  Our plan is to reopen bigger and busier than ever.  We are asking for help from our community and those from afar that support independent venues. OUR STORY 'TIL NOW-Gateway City Arts, in downtown Holyoke, MA., began 9 years ago when my partner, a professional art restorer and artist, needed a new studio space.  After a long search for affordable space we fell in love with a mill building in Holyoke. We have a beautiful building with a total of 40,000 square foot in a diverse and challenged city in Western MA. The city has a rich history and amazing potential.  We decided to buy the building and create a community, art and cultural center.  We put our hearts, time, sweat, money and tears into creating this multi-functional venue.  We had to totally redo the building to bring it up to code. Our opening helped bring other new businesses to the area, thus greatly contributing to the beginning of the revitalization of the downtown.  What began as a small art venue for studios and classes has morphed into a restaurant with food and alcohol, event spaces, live theater, and a world class music venue for local, national and internationally touring bands.  GCA is a destination and brings thousands of people to the area annually.Vitek, my partner, comes from the Czech Republic and his training is in restoring castles, cathedrals, buildings and creating/restoring fine art.  My background is totally different- I am a Physical Therapist by training and discovered art as an adult.  What does this have to do with anything? Our interests and values intersect around people- our desire to be in community, our interest in justice, learning, creating and inspiring.  We began building Gateway (GCA) by doing most of the construction ourselves and it slowly evolved into a complex, multifaceted business with almost 40 employees and volunteers at one point.  They are local, dedicated and believe in our vision.  We worked hard at creating a professional environment in whatever we offer and welcome everyone to our facility.  We grew from small concerts to sell out crowds of 500 people with national touring bands.  GCA is home to a terrific puppeteer company, an alternative theater group, artists, craftsmen, and people from start-up to career professionals in various fields of art, design and performing arts.  And we have events from corporate meetings and retreats to weddings!YOUR HELP WILL KEEP THIS VITAL VENUE AVAILABLE TO THE COMMUNITY OF ARTISTS, THE CITY OF HOLYOKE AND THE PIONEER VALLEY. WE DON'T KNOW HOW ELSE TO KEEP GOING DURING THIS TIME. PLEASE HELP WITH ANY SIZE DONATION--It is more than welcome and extremely appreciated.  THANKS FOR LISTENING-With gratitude,Lori and Vitek#SmallBusinessRelief

Please watch our latest trailer on this link :) WINE and WAR Trailer WINE and WAR is due for global release in September and the film’s collaborators Mark Johnston, Mark Ryan and Michael Karam are pledging up to $50,000* to Cap-Ho, a Lebanese charity that provides much-needed medical care to those without insurance. An amazing journeyTheir adventure began in 2013, when, inspired by Michael Karam’s award-winning book Wines of Lebanon, the trio teamed up with a mission: to change perceptions of the region and explore an enigmatic and misunderstood country by producing a feature length documentary that celebrated Lebanese entrepreneurship in times of conflict and instability through the lens of wine. The film will not only highlight the determination of Lebanon’s winemakers, but also the remarkable story of the Lebanese throughout history. And while the film is called WINE and WAR, the focus is really on a remarkable people, fighting to live and work in difficult conditions very often not of their own making.This unique documentary explains this historical journey, with testimonies from those who fought to make wine in the 1975-90 civil war, the 2006 summer war, and those who continue to produce in the shadow of regional instability. Their astonishing stories tell of bravery, determination, and survival and how wine can be a unifier and a metaphor for life, hospitality, civilization, and a force for good in a region defined by turmoil and animosity.An epic wine cultureLebanon’s relationship with the vine culture stretches back, almost 7,000 years. In the second millennium BC, the Phoenicians, a Canaanite people who inhabited the Levantine coast, created a powerful trading empire that gave the gift of wine to the then known world, including Greece and ancient Rome. They were the first wine merchants!The power of the DiasporaThe Lebanese have continued to travel the world. So while there are 4.5 million people in Lebanon, there are a further 10 million of Lebanese descent scattered across the five continents and they can be instrumental in changing the perception of Lebanon, through a film that can renew a sense of identity and pride among a huge diaspora scattered across the world.A story more relevant now than everBut above all, as we brace ourselves for change not seen in our lifetime, WINE and WAR is a compelling reminder that history is fraught with challenges that have been faced and ultimately overcome. In a region that is not automatically associated with wine, it is a story of epic achievement, one that shows the best side of its humanity, it’s history; it’s tradition of hospitality, and its generosity of spirit.In a time of global angst, when Lebanon is not only dealing with the Covid pandemic, but also fighting corruption, environmental crises and sectarian politics not to mention navigating choppy economic waters, the WINE and WAR is a timely reminder that uncertainty is a way of life for many but that out of uncertainty can come remarkable resilience, and positivity. We need your help With 300 hours of video being uploaded to YouTube every minute and 5 billion videos watched every day, we need your help to navigate the blizzard of content that so often blinds us these days. WINE and WAR is finished but we need to raise $50,000 to pay for the marketing of this legacy film.  We could do it for more, or maybe less but the amount will allow us to genuinely achieve a global audience that will show Lebanon in a positive light.  A global movementOur following on Facebook and Instagram, especially in South America is growing quickly and we have produced a short fund-raising film, which highlights our support of Cap-Ho and a “teaser”, both of which are attached. A full “trailer” will follow very shortly. Perceptions are everything today and we have the film to change them, but we need your support to give Lebanon a voice. Please let us know what you think, and if you have any ideas to make this exciting joint initiative more impactful please reach out to us.Lastly here is a link to view the WINE and WAR Trailer *Whatever money is generated from funding raising, up to $50,000, will be matched in a contribution to Cap-Ho from the films revenues

If these songs are fruit from my life, they're not meant to stay hidden, but to be offered. Lately I've been reminded of people and places across different seasons of my life that have shaped who I am and encouraged this part of what I am created to do. If you're reading this, I bet you're one of them! We didn't build “record an album"" into our year, especially given these recent months, so that's where the risk comes in ;)  We've been working hard and believing hard for the funds needed. I humbly want to ask for your prayers and I invite you to sow into this project financially. Funds will cover tracking, mixing, mastering, and creating a bit of supporting content around the music.The grace we have felt around doing this has been unmistakable. In early June I felt a clear “NOW” that I couldn’t ignore. It's time. This is taking big faith, but that’s part of every story involving a big YES, isn’t it? I can’t fully express how much your support means as this becomes a reality. And with equal joy I can't wait to share this music with you. LOVE,  Kiley"

Together, we will work to celebrate and preserve Visual Arts Collective as a hub for culture, community and artistic expression for generations to come. VAC has been closed for over 6 months and has been paying the bills with an SBA loan that runs out in October. While VAC plans to reopen as soon as they are safely able to do so, at the moment every show has been cancelled off the VAC schedule until 2021. Shows that do plan to go forward will be able to sell tickets at 30% capacity. This is not a sustainable business model. Current social distance guidelines will impact every aspect of the business and most shows will barely break even.   Project VACscene is raising funds to help VAC slowly reopen and subsidize lost revenues and operating expenses for the next 6 months: November 2020 - May 2021. Monies raised will support monthly operational expenses until Spring of 2021 when hopefully things have improved. For example, it costs $12,000 a month for bare-bones rent and utilities, and while small gatherings are currently allowed in Stage 4, every event at VAC in 2020 has been cancelled.Your donation will pay for: +  Building Rent +  Utilities +  Ongoing supplies to keep VAC safe and clean (when open)+  Extra security to enforce CoVid social distance requirements (when open)+  Funds to cover staff hourly for shows that do not break even+  CoVid related building upgrades and expenses To help reopen VAC and to keep it open now and the future we need to raise $96,650.00.  You can give in direct and meaningful ways:+ Click the Donate Now button! + Give to the Art Auction on the theme ""Love Letters For VAC"" (happening in December)   + Submit letters to ""Love Letters For VAC"" for an art book available for purchase in Feb 2021! Project VACscene and Love Letters for VAC has the full support of the VAC team.

It might surprise you to know that they are  not great moneymakers. In fact, these two separate (but very connected) businesses run on very  small margins and actually suffer losses on some of their less popular productions. The corona virus has closed these venues indefinitely because of the city's shelter-in-place rules.While Dan and Laurie Pessano, at GCP, and Roger Rocka, who owns the dinner theater, have vowed to re-open as soon as possible, there will likely be major restrictions on public gatherings when they do. The theaters will probably have to open to half capacity to meet state and local requirements. Since they don't make much profit on any show, even with a full house, they will undoubtedly lose money on shows until we get back to our real lives. They need us. Several people have already forfeited their season ticket value to help out; but, even if we all did that, it won't be nearly enough. Please chip in. Our initial  goal is $50,000. If that's not enough, we'll ask again.There are many worthy causes out there, including many non-profit organizations that need your help. We encourage you to give to them as well. But Fresno cannot lose Good Company Players and Roger Rocka's. In the cultural sense, these are our theaters. They give us many hours of joy that cannot be replaced.

I know right.That’s exactly what went through my head when I got the call telling me that Vinnie’s estate decided that I would be the honorable recipient to take on this legendary vehicle. They knew that I would love it, care for it, respect it as a “Pantera museum on wheels,” and bring it roaring back to life. So many celebrities, family, friends, strippers, politicians and more have been inside this limo.  Marilyn Manson famously did donuts outside Vinnie’s “Clubhouse” one time.  Vinnie used to drive it to go shopping, drive-through restaurants, and of course to party ALL THE TIME.I had the honor of partying in it back in 2008 in Dallas, and Vinnie played me some HELLYEAH demos out of his monstrous sound system.  I remember my insides were vibrating so hard from the intense volume and kick from those speakers, goddamn!?Now all these years later, I find myself in a very extraordinary situation, one that I would never imagine.  Being the proud new owner of Vinnie Paul’s limousine?!Vinnie wanted to restore this limo while he was alive, but it cost way too much.  He even contacted a known TV show to help him pimp it out, but they wanted a ton of money to fix it up.  It needs a SHIT TON of work.Getting the limo to California from Vegas has burned a hole through my wallet, along with other expenses that barely got this beast rolling. It’s gonna take a lot to get this on the road again. I need to pay for engine work, body work, paint, transmission, power window/trunk motors, stereo/visual equipment (super important!), tires, wheels, brakes, lights, interior seats/carpet, vinyl roofing, front windshield, sun roof, detailing, registration, insurance, storage, and more costs that I have no idea that will undoubtedly happen.I need your help please.  Here’s where YOU come in.Every dollar donated will go to complete the restoration of the limo that I inherited from my idol Vinnie Paul.If you donate $33 or up you’ll get your name engraved on the inside of the trunk.  It could be your name, your band name, your organization, your company, your pet’s name, or anything you want.  Whatever it is, it’ll be forever immortalized on this iconic piece of rock history. Throughout the limo pimping out process we’ll be updating this page and our socials with cool videos and exclusive content. I can’t do ANY of this without your help.Massive THANX to my brother Sonny Guillen for this great idea after hearing me stress out about how I was going to pay for this stuff.  He convinced me to do this, and I appreciate his assistance in helping me to run and manage this.We know that this is an extremely difficult time, and we’re not asking you to hurt your bank account, or not pay a bill because of this.  But if you can donate to help get this piece of Heavy Metal history back on the road again, AND get your name engraved inside the “Pantera limo,” well then, it’s a win-win for ALL!Hope you are healthy and safe, and THANK YOU for considering, maybe for donating, but mostly for loving Heavy Metal, and the music Vinnie and Dime left behind!Peace in a celebrated cloud of music...Jose “Metal Ambassador” ManginThanXxx...Edwin Daboub (video)Eddie Veliz (animation)Kyng (music)Sonny Guillen (CFH)Bridog, Jake Lawson & VP’s estate

TRANS PEOPLE ARE SACREDNATIONAL BILLBOARD CAMPAIGNIn recent months, the Transgender community has been faced with numerous calculated attacks from the current administration. Intentionally regressive policy reform has led to increased systematic discrimination against Trans people. This has led to the loss of vital protections in healthcare, housing, homelessness resources, and the cruel and sudden exclusion of Trans people from military service. These are fundamental human rights, all of which are necessary for our survival.The violent murders of Black Trans Women and Trans Women of Color remain at epidemic levels. In 2020 we have already seen too many brilliant individuals taken from this world by force. The public should be a safe place for Trans and gender non-conforming people to exist freely.It is our goal to reclaim public space for the Trans community.Our bodies are holy ground, our magic is potent and true, and our existence makes the world a more loving and equitable place for all. We have always been here and always will be. We demand safety for our community. We demand the right to exist without being targeted. We demand understanding. We will continue to work tirelessly until these demands are met.Now is the time to bring our light into the world like never before.In July of 2019, Transgender artist and activist Jonah Welch  launched a billboard in Detroit, Michigan, in collaboration with Save Art Space  and Ellen Rutt . The billboard proclaimed ""Trans People Are Sacred,” a phrase that was first shared with Jonah by Dakota Camacho  years earlier while they were residents of the Audre Lorde Cooperative in Madison, Wisconsin.The billboard was intended to strengthen representation and inspire hope for Trans individuals in Detroit, but the piece spread like wildfire. The billboard reached a global audience. The words, Trans People Are Sacred, took root, and catalyzed profound healing for individuals and communities the world over. After the success of the initial billboard, Save Art Space reached out to Jonah Welch to create a national-level project for this work. Now we have the opportunity to spread this message even farther.WE NEED YOUR HELPIt is our goal to place these billboards in one hundred cities across the United States, with a distinct focus on conservative areas in the south and southwest. The billboards will go up between mid-September and mid-October, just weeks before the election, so that our voices can be heard. Because of its inherent accessibility and visibility, it is our belief that public art holds the potential to shift culture. Each $1000 we raise will allow us to place a billboard in another city. The additional $52k will be used to pay 52 Trans & Non-Binary BIPOC artists $1000 each for their work (50 visual artists and two curators). And while our initial goal is $152k, we hope to exceed this amount and cover the country with this beacon of hope. 

CALL FOR BIPOC ARTISTSWe are dedicating the majority of billboard space to the work of Trans & Non-Binary BIPOC artists. All art must include the phrase ""Trans People are Sacred"" or a culturally-rooted variation on this phrase specific to the artist. (ex: ""Black Trans People are Sacred""). We encourage artists to interpret this phrase through the lens of their ancestral language and culture. Each selected artist will be paid $1000 for their work.The cohort of BIPOC artists will be selected by Dakota Camacho  and Ryan Young . For submission guidelines, to suggest a billboard location, or to inquire about press opportunities please contact Jonah via the Gofundme contact form.

This past week we were vandalized. Our security gate has been broken, and our front doors were shattered. We have also had some minor graffiti on the outside of the building. Your generous donations will assist with these repairs and some general maintenance that the Crest Sacramento desperately needs. We would typically be able to afford these unexpected expenditures but have been closed since mid-March due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Due to the pandemic, we have had to reduce our staff significantly and are doing our best to accommodate customer service requests as they come in. We are hopeful that we can resume some sort of programming in the fall, but as time passes, it looks like we will not be able to reopen operations until 2021. As we are postponing and rescheduling concerts to accommodate the mandated gathering restrictions, ticket holders will be able to hold onto their tickets to attend the rescheduled events. Should you have questions, please email us at [email redacted]We are relying on your donations to help get through these uncertain times, so you can continue to depend on us to keep bringing Sacramento rich and diverse entertainment. Your generous contributions will help to repair this iconic Sacramento landmark. Any additional funds raised above the cost of these repairs will keep the Crest Theatre operational. At the same time, we anxiously await the time when we can come together as a community and start healing through arts, music & film.We can not thank you enough,Robert Alvis,General Manager

Think of where they happened. We’re willing to bet that at least one of them happened at a concert. Our industry is based around the idea of bringing people together for shared communal artistic experiences, and our industry is in real trouble. In March of this year the first cancellations came, and what at the time felt like a weekend of lost revenue has now turned in to a year of lost revenue. This has affected musicians, agents, managers, and fans in ways that are profound and direct, though at the center of it all independent venues have been affected in ways that are almost incalculable.Independent venues are rooms that don’t have the backing of a national or international conglomerate. They are owned by people that have a stake in the communities that they seek to serve. They come in all shapes and sizes. From Sun Tiki to The Apohadion to Blue, from SPACE Gallery to One Longfellow Square and all the way up to Port City Music Hall, the State Theatre and Thompson’s Point. We are an ecosystem that cannot operate individually and we understand that together we are stronger than one. Over the last ten years our venues have brought thousands of shows, bands, ideas and unique experiences to our city. Collectively, we are one of the biggest employers in Portland. We generate millions of dollars in both direct and indirect revenue and we brought credibility to a city that was once without much credibility in the touring industry. Bands that had never really thought about playing Portland are now automatically including Portland in their touring plans. Throughout the past several years, the biggest beneficiary of all of this was the fans. Portland has some of the best fans in existence. In turn, our venues always try to treat fans with the respect and dignity that they deserve. Our fans are recognized as the lifeblood that keeps venues, musicians, and the industry as a whole resilient day after day, year after year. Now our venues need you more than ever. If you value our venues as much as we value you, our fans, please donate whatever amount is comfortable for you. All donations will be pooled and distributed to Portland’s music venues based on metrics of need, capacity and operating costs. Any amount helps.We sincerely appreciate all of you.

This campaign is for my former (forever) student, Kevin Belcher. I taught Kevin in band for three years at Price Middle School in Atlanta, GA. Every single dime raised will go towards Kevin's musical studies. We (his mother and I) intend on opening up a bank account/trust fund from which he can withdraw the campaign funds on an as need basis. Kevin Belcher is a 16 year old rising junior and budding musician at Maynard Jackson High School in Atlanta, Georgia. Having overcome many obstacles in order to pursue his dream of becoming a prominent and successful musician, his aspirations were finally realized. On June 17th, 2020, Kevin was accepted into the world renowned Interlochen Arts Academy to study classical clarinet! (Learn more about Interlochen here. https://www.interlochen.org/) Kevin has managed to navigate himself through personal adversity and persevere through many obstacles. He has managed to hold strong in his pursuit of his dreams, despite the lack of examples to visualize himself in the spaces he desires, and as a result, the temptation to give up. And although he is blessed to have family, friends, and teachers who uplift and push him; he still requires major financial support in order to fully realize his pursuits to attend Interlochen. His deposit of $1,700.00 is due on July 1st, 2020 with the remainder of his $66,000 tuition ($25,000 after his scholarship) to be paid in the fall of the 2020-2021 school year. All additional funds will go towards next (senior) year's tuition.This is where you come in. Kevin needs to raise $25,000 in order to have the chance to experience, study, and be in the same spaces of talented and like minded student musicians such as himself. He understands that it is not going to be easy. However, he believes, with our support, he will be prepared for the inevitable challenges that lie ahead and will be reinvigorated to put in the work to pursue his dreams and aspirations. I believe I can speak for him and say unequivocally, that Kevin will be eternally grateful for every single contribution toward reaching his goal.Kevin’s final performance is on July 19th, at First Presbyterian Church of Atlanta, 1328 Peachtree St. NE, Atlanta 30309 during the 11 am service.  If possible, please support him in his farewell performance to Interlochen by attending and donating to his tuition fund. Thank you in advance for any contribution you can make towards his goal. All of the proceeds raised will go towards his tuition, room, board, uniform, and supplies needed in order to attend this prestigious academy. With sincere gratitude,Tara Byrdong on Behalf of Kevin Belcher

Now, as a young BIPOC 24 year old artist, he’s on the streets documenting and live streaming these important events of our time. You can follow Chai on his journey, streaming the protests at Future Crystals on Instagram that followed the devastating event of the murder of George Floyd but more specifically, the movement to Defund the Police on Coast Salish Territory. At this very moment your meaningful donation will support a young BIPOC artist pay for his invaluable time to protect protesters by streaming this intensely political moment, equipment for rain protection, digital storage, gas money, protest equipment to stay safe on the streets, bail funds for protestors, base camp venue support, and stipends for the camera crew. Chai has been tirelessly documenting for days and will do so for as long as people on the streets rise up to this important call to action.

As the largest public database of Black talent in film, we look to serve production companies in finding new talent to represent; creative agencies in finding fresh voices to bring their campaigns to life; most of all we are in service of the Black film community, aiming to increase job opportunities, equity, and influence in the creative community. For us, by us. We’ve been featured in publications such as AdAge  and Little Black Book  and have had an overwhelmingly positive response from supporters all over the globe. Our mission is to identify the needs of our community and work with agencies, brands, and production companies to transform the way we approach bidding and hiring. By this point we all know that diversity raises the bottom line and creates more dynamic stories, but how do creative institutions implement ‘diversity’ on an operational level? This is the enigma we are seeking to unpack at Bid Black. Currently, we are working on rolling out new features on our website for the community we serve and we would love your support in helping us do so. Bid Black will begin presenting the work of talent represented on the site in a library format for a curated viewing experience. Also in development is the expansion of the database into other creative roles like composers, production designers, animators and producers. Please help us remain a 100% free and accessible service to everyone as we grow. Bid Black was created in 2018 by Sydni Chustz along with the help of several other contributors who have lent their time and love to this effort. Join our village and help us transform the way we tell stories. We are extremely humbled for all the support we’ve received thus far and will remain unmoved on our mission to increase visibility of Black filmmakers everywhere.

When John Shackelford discovered cycling an entirely new world opened up to him. The freedom that came with it empowered him to access opportunities and a future he’d never dreamed of before. As for many of us, 2020 has made him reconsider where Black people have come from and where they are now. Is there really a difference? Are we all truly free? John has decided to embark on a journey of endurance and determination as a medium to process this struggle. At 25 years old, the age many black men meet their demise, the New York City bike messenger will cycle 1,114 miles along the Underground Railroad, a life and death trek for those who attempted it in the early to mid-1800s.This is adventure cycling, a discipline marked by a vast underrepresentation of POC. This is a story of activism, adventure and deep connection to the ancestors along the way. This is a ride of protest, resistance, and hope. The film documenting his passage is our call to action to act as both witnesses to history while also active participants. We’ve been humbled by the outpouring of support and generosity the teaser has inspired, but we still have a long way to go. With our community behind us, we can fuel John’s dream and capture every second along the way.Check out our teaser here: https://vimeo.com/444124103/descriptionFollow us on Instagram: @undergroundrailroadrideWebsite:https://www.undergroundrailroadride.com

This campaign is to benefit James Chance and his longtime partner Judy Taylor. James is known as a musician, saxophonist, singer, songwriter, and one of the leaders of the Funk / /Punk  / Jazz / No Wave movements that began in the late 1970s in downtown New York City, with his groundbreaking groups The Contortions and James White and the Blacks.

James and Judy currently live in New York and have both been severely affected by personal health issues and the COVID situation. James had to cut short his European tour last year due to a sudden health crisis, and Judy suffers from a long term debilitating illness that keeps her confined to home. The family has hopes that James will recover, however there is scarce employment for musicians during this time of pandemic.

In October of last year, James' father Donald Siegfried who had been James' lifeline of support during his health crisis, died rather suddenly, and his mother, Jean Siegfried, had to be relocated to a memory care facility, leaving little in the way of family funds to continue support to James and Judy.

Any donations you are able to give at this time will be going directly to cover the cost of James and Judy's medical and living expenses, and any funds beyond their immediate needs will go into a retirement fund for James.

James and Judy and the Siegfried family will be very grateful for any amount that you can contribute, as the funds will lift a burden from the Siegfried family as we are all concerned over James and Judy's welfare.

Hey Yall!I'm Ahya Simone and I'm an internationally acclaimed harpist/composer/filmmaker. Right now, I am in need of a new concert grand harp.I've been playing the harp for 12 years- receiving my Bachelor's degree from Wayne State University in 2014 for Harp performance. I have also performed alongside artists such as Kelela, Juliana Huxtable, Tunde Olaniran and Kelsey Lu.   Receiving an electro-acoustic harp will allow me to play both acoustically, as well allow me to play easily with amplifications, a quality sound for recording sessions, add electronic effects,  perform in larger rooms, and create innovative on-stage soundscapes . In order to decide on a harp, I also must travel to harp showrooms and try them out before buying. I will need to travel from Virginia, New Jersey, and Chicago to test multiple harps out. I am looking to make my goal as soon as possible to finish my début Electronic R&B EP, and to enhance my live performances and collaborations. It would really mean a lot to me to know you support and believe in my art to help me continue exploring the harp outside of classical music. If you help me reach my goal, I will give a free 30 min virtual concert on my new instrument at a later date! See price breakdowns and check out some of my work below.

That's why we at Emerald Media are seeking funding to produce a Black voter engagement video project to be released across digital platforms in the lead up to the 2020 presidential election. The project will comprise a series of short videos, set against the backdrop of the election and the pandemic, profiling Black people living in cities with significant Black populations. The project is the first part of a series we are developing to amplify Black voices in the American political story. Our goal is to increase Black voter engagement as a method of empowerment for Black people and communities. In an election where door knocking will be severely limited due to the pandemic, we know that storytelling will be an even more important tool than usual to reach voters. When Black voters, as is the case with all voters,  recognize themselves in the narrative of the election, they will vote. Emerald Media is uniquely qualified to undertake such a project.  We are campaign professionals, organizers, researchers, and filmmakers, committed to building a more equitable and inclusive world. From education in underserved communities to criminal justice reform to political candidacies, we have captured a number of subjects and issues related to the Black experience in America.For samples of our video work, please click here.The funds will be used for production and distribution, which includes:1) Production fees, including the hiring of crews2) Equipment rental3)Transportation and lodging for production staff4) EditingWith less than 3 weeks to go in the most consequential election of our lifetime, please consider a contribution so we can do this essential work.Thank you!Jordan, Sophia, Chris & the Whole Team at the Emerald Media

We collectivized in response to the deep-seated and ongoing underappreciation, undervaluing, and underfunding of Black queer art. We focus on uplifting Black LGBTQIA+ voices and experiences by: creating space for artistic endeavors, compensating fairly for time and work, and fostering fellowship and opportunity for our communities, present and future. The conversation on the seat at the table owed to Black people in media and the arts has reached a peak pitch in recent times. As Black queer artists, we dedicate ourselves to creating artistically striking works that shift culture and offer largely excluded perspectives. In the past, like so many of our peers, we've had to accomplish our creative visions with little to no resources, often relying on ambition and drive to push our projects forward.Despite our financial limitations, we've accomplished a great deal with our craft both collectively and individually. In this time of global pandemic, we are not being paid to make art. For the most part, we are not getting paid at all. At this time, we are looking toward those who enjoy and benefit from our art to also invest in our future. To execute this vision, we are asking for more than a seat at the table.Instead, we intend to build our own table. Thus, we are launching a production company that will focus on providing resources to artists and creatives most often underrepresented in media. Our community has contributed to mainstream culture for far too long without compensation, and we are ready to enact change.In order to launch this production company, we have set a goal to raise $100k. This money will go to paying artists for their time and talents, securing tech (costuming, cinematography, makeup artists, choreographers, editors, etc), renting spaces, and producing fully realized visions. We have projects in the works spanning music, performance art, screenwriting, theatre, dance, and more.  Any donation, big or small, can make a huge difference in helping us achieve our goals while doing what we love most.  Thank you so much for your time and support. Peace&Love,Legacy*founding members: Basit, Garrett, Kyle, Ashton

Our small town high school show choir is a point of pride for the Findlay community, and FFE has made a name for itself across the United States for excellence in show and character. First Edition teaches you teamwork, self discipline, and empathy. If you know anything about the late nights, tap rehearsals, summer camp meltdowns, or have been to a Cabaret show, you understand that FFE is more than an extracurricular activity. It breeds passionate, hardworking artists.On an average year, the target budget for FFE is somewhere around $80,000. That's right-- dresses, competition fees, our choreographer Andy, travel expenses: it's all paid for by fundraising. With the loss of both of major fundraisers in 2020, the group stands to miss out on a year of performing, traveling, or even rehearsing with any degree of normalcy.We’d be remiss not to point out that everyone is struggling this year; everywhere you turn, there is another fundraiser for something equally (if not more) important than singing and dancing in a sequin dress and tap shoes. But we’ve been in those shoes, and the show must go on. The FFE alumni have taken it upon themselves to raise $50,000 to pledge in donation to Findlay First Edition, and we need the help of the Findlay community and beyond to get us to our goal.Whatever you can give, big or small, know that you’re providing support and opportunity to a group of dynamic, hardworking singers, dancers, crew members, and musicians. This is what it truly means to “Go With a Song in Your Heart.”Much love and many thanks,The FFE Alumni Network

Values, health, beliefs, finances, security, freedoms … EVERYTHING we’ve known has been challenged and tested … turned on its head. Now, one imperative stands out. If we are going to survive as a Democracy, if we are going to stick together as a nation, the next few years will be the most critical ones we’ve ever faced. I’m not talking about political preferences. I’m talking about our future, the very HEART and SOUL of America … what we say we—as a ‘people’—believe.Still…When a deadly virus can take nearly 200,000 lives in the U.S. while some scoff at scientific data and medical advice, at the same time claiming that the government, or some crazy conspiracy, is trying to take away their ‘freedoms’ by demanding that masks be worn and social distancing be adhered to … with no thought for their fellow citizens …When people of color, believing what AMERICA promises, hunger for the equality and justice guaranteed to them as citizens by the Constitution, are denied access to what their fellow white Americans have enjoyed for more than 250 years… When a society, torn by systemic racism and preferential treatment, turns on those whose skin color or lack of money or status, leads to brutality delivered by the very police officers sworn to ʻserve and protect,’ and when that brutality exacerbates the violence that then gives rise to intimidation, death, and destruction, and eventually the involvement of anarchists bent on their own cause…Well, then…It’s time to back off, regroup, and take a good hard look at who we are as a people and as a country … both the good and the bad. These remarkable events have given impetus to a short documentary film that follows the best and the worst of WHO we are as a people and a nation, from our inception in the early 17th century up to and including 2020 and beyond. Who are we? Who do we say we want to be? What have we become? … and, finally, what can we be again if we STICK TOGETHER?Underpinning this message is a song I recorded forty years ago, called AMERICA, written by my friend, Jack Murphy. I loved the song, but it didn’t really fit with the selection of songs I was putting together for an album called THE BEST DAYS OF MY LIFE. Ironic, you might say. In any case, I put AMERICA on the shelf where it’s been sitting for the past four decades, patiently waiting for the right moment. Well, the time has come. The message of the film is urgently needed, perhaps more than ever. ‘WE THE PEOPLE,’ even as we resolved back in 1776, need to stick together to make America a better place for all.This not-for-profit short film documentary will be available to EVERYONE for free online and on all platforms. But, at the moment, the challenge for the producers is that archival video footage, and past and present pictorial images from the various photo agencies that we need to work with to tell the story of AMERICA, are rather expensive. So, we are appealing to you to help us make this short film a reality. Will you help us, please?I honestly don’t like asking for money, but in this case, we are in need of around $25,000 to complete the film. I do believe you will find it thought-provoking and thoroughly worthwhile. Please give what you can, and for your generous gifts, there will be gifts for you, too.On behalf of AMERICA, I thank you in advance.David SoulDONATION PERKSYou will be a player in the production of this documentary—and in ‘changing the world’ (at least the world within the United States).$25-$49 (USD)An Autographed GOLD CD and On-Site Supporter CreditAs a contributor in this amount range, you’ll receive an autographed GOLD CD, as well as have your name featured as a Supporter on the AMERICA webpage. $50-$99 (USD)A Personalized Autographed GOLD CD and On-Site Supporter CreditAs a contributor in this amount range, you’ll receive a personalized autographed GOLD CD, as well as have your name featured as a Supporter on the AMERICA webpage.$100-$249 (USD)Personalized Autographed AMERICA Postcard and On-Site Contributor CreditA limited edition autographed POSTCARD of an American Bald Eagle drawn exclusively by David Soul, and personalized to you, as well.

These last few months have been challenging for us all but we are determined to bring quality entertainment back to the Roaring Fork Valley for years to come. But to do that, we need your help. In order for us to open, the regulations state that we can only have 25% of our capacity and reduced cast size for the foreseeable future. But this leaves us with a very tight margin to succeed. We want to keep our prices as low as possible, so everyone who has been impacted by the recent closures, might still be able to afford a night out for some much needed laughter. So we are asking our community and fans all over the country and world for a bit of help. On Thursday, July 9th, we will be having our first ever Live and Virtual Fundraiser. This show will be our all New Live Summer Show but it will also be live streamed out to the world for everyone to see free of charge. During the performance, we will be connecting with those who join us online and giving shout outs to those who donate online. We also have several amazing guest artists who will be joining us remotely or via previously recorded performances!And we will be developing our ""The Show Must Go On Wall of Fame"" and everyone who donates now or in the future, will get a Vaudeville Boater Hat with your name and donation amount mounted on our wall for all time. The audience for this show will be invited guests only but we hope that all of our fans and customers will watch on line and through laughter be motivated to help us through this challenging time. The details of how this will be live streamed will be announced on our website and social media very soon.All the money raised will go directly and immediately to The Glenwood Vaudeville Revue to help pay our performers and staff as well as help pay bills that added up during the shut down as well as help keep us afloat in the days ahead when we can only do 2 shows a week to only 25% of our usual audience. Thank you so much for all of your support! Together we will keep live theatre happening in the Roaring Fork Valley for years to come! Sincerely, John GossOwner & Director of the Glenwood Vaudeville Revue"

I am raising money for ""Livin' in the Light"", a short film and musical EP. The film documents my experience of singing in Portland during quarantine and at protests as one of the only Black male professional opera singers in the Pacific Northwest working in modern/crossover genres. COVID-19 canceled all of my singing events with Portland Opera and multiple other local opera companies, as well as all other bookings at events around town. All of our amphitheaters and venues are closed. Given that I live in a small space with roommates, I have nowhere to practice. My voice is an instrument. If I don't use it, I risk losing it. To be able to practice, I have resorted to singing in the streets. I also sing at Black Lives Matter and civil rights protests. In the last two months, I’ve been stopped by building security guards on numerous occasions and have had the cops called on me just for singing. Knowing that 1 in 1000 black men and boys in America can expect to die at the hands of police, I am quite literally risking my life to preserve my instrument and practice my art. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has found that African Americans account for 33 percent of COVID hospitalizations, largely because Black people have high rates of chronic health conditions—called comorbidities—that weaken the immune system and make them more vulnerable to the virus. But much less discussed is how food, class, and race have intersected in ways that perpetuate the health disparities and social inequities unfolding today. By losing access to income from events and ticket sales, I’ve encountered even greater risk — both physical and economic — in the face of the pandemic.  The film will be directed by me and produced by non-profit queer creative studio Future Prairie, lead by Portland Parks and Recreation creative-in-residence Joni Renee Whitworth. Future Prairie is raising money through a variety of sources, including grants from foundations and larger non-profits, this campaign, individual donors, and virtual fundraising events. We're raising $15,000 for the documentary, $10,000 for the EP of music, and $5,000 for the music video that will accompany both pieces. Livin' in the Light is a bold, timely message to creatives, urging them to keep making and sharing art during the pandemic and challenging institutional responses to this crisis. My film and music document the impact of COVID-19 on Black creatives. This work is an attempt to witness and index the joy, perseverance, and struggle of being a Black male artist in what is often called ""the Whitest City in America"" while honoring the timeless art form that is opera."

Mackey . I am a photographer/activist (based in Atlanta) that is currently traveling the country, documenting the Black Lives Matter movement and protests. After spending countless weeks on the road, I realized that I had accumulated enough content to publish a photo book that could document the movement from the perspective of those of us that were on the ground.Many times, the news provides an account of events that doesn’t fully communicate the context and/or nuances of the events being reported. My goal is to provide an account from the perspective of the protestors and activists as we saw it.All funds from this campaign will go toward the costs of production (Approximately $8,000), as well as travel expenses for additional content needed to complete the book. (Approximately $2,000).EVERY donor will be recognized, by name, on a “Thank You” page in the book. Those individuals that wish to donate anonymously will be recognized under an “Anonymous Donor” section with a “*” to represent each person that contributed.Anyone that donates $50 or more to the project will receive a complimentary copy of the book when it is complete. If this is you, please be sure to send me a message with your shipping information.Proceeds from the sale of the book will go toward an exhibit that is to be held during Black History Month, 2021, featuring the work of Black creatives that were on the ground during the protests.Please follow me on IG at: @emackeycreates  to view some of my work and videos from the protest.

I do not know Rodney personally, but his story has captivated me. He is a self taught bass trombonist who’s been playing for 2.5 years. In that short amount of time, he has participated in the Honor Orchestra of America, Indiana All-State, Indianapolis Youth Orchestra, and Indianapolis Side-by-Side. On June 30, 2020, he was selected to continue his studies at the prestigious Interlochen Arts Academy (IAA) in Michigan. (Find out more about Interlochen here https://www.interlochen.org/) Rodney was awarded $55,000 in scholarship funds, however he still needs assistance in reaching the $75,000 for tuition. Additionally, he will need assistance in obtaining a MacBook, as it is a requirement for all students at IAA. I am reaching out to the village on behalf of Rodney to raise the remaining $25,000 to attend IAA. $2000 of that total was due for a deposit to enroll yesterday, July 7th. Luckily, he has been granted an extension. Demonstrated by his sheer tenacity, Rodney has proven that he is more than capable of doing hard work. While his dad is a truck driver and his mom an in-home caretaker for the elderly, Rodney currently works 8-9 hour shifts at Papa Johns in order to contribute to his own tuition fund for IAA. The instrument he currently plays was acquired through his fundraising. He practices many hours a day. Did I mention he’s self taught? We can not let his hard work and determination be for naught. Will you help me send this deserving young man to Interlochen? #interlochenbound

It's only in the last two months that I've really thought about my past shows at length. Just under 23 years ago I booked my first show in North Florida: a sellout with Big Bad Voodoo Daddy at Fat Kat Music Hall. A year later Anne, my wife, opened Jack Rabbits with Big Sky as our first show. (They sold us out too!) When asked about my favorite shows, I always talk about what's to come. But, like so many, the concert world is at a standstill. Plans to ""reopen the country"" list concerts and theaters in the last stages and that’s with a reduced capacity. But we know that music is as much a part of life as breathing is to so many people. Shows WILL happen! We just need to make it through this transition. OUR CURRENT REALITY:  So far we haven’t qualified for any of the government “small business” programs or even been approved for unemployment. We’ve made it through lean times before. When the touring industry was devastated for over a year after 9/11, we held in there. That’s why Jack Rabbits is one of the oldest venues of its size in the southeast. But our reserves are running out. We’re going to need help to keep JaxLive and Jack Rabbits alive. We've started a GoFundMe with a goal of $22,000:  $1,000 for each of our 22 years of shows. In addition to our operating costs, the shutdown interrupted a loan application that we’d started to pay for, among other things, a new shed for our walkin cooler. Though “the other things” can wait, a new shed cannot. We also need to make changes to Jack Rabbits to follow new safety guidelines in light of Covid-19. Again, that takes money. HOW TO HELP:  If you can help, Anne and I thank you. Lisa, Rob, Lee and the rest of the extended family at Jack Rabbits and JaxLive thank you. Times past we’ve been able to help others out. But there’s also been times that we couldn't because we just didn’t have it to spare. So please don’t worry if you can’t donate today. We know we're not the only ones struggling right now. Just save up so that you can come out to hear that new band you like the next time they're in town. That's helping too! Please let your friends & family know about our campaign via your Instagram, Facebook and/or Twitter with the hashtag #KeepJaxLive. OUR THANKS:  As a token of our appreciation, donors that contribute $100 will receive a complimentary ticket to any Jack Rabbits show and two drink tickets.  Donors that contribute $500 will receive a pair of tickets to a Jack Rabbits show and a $100 bar-tab at Jack Rabbits. Please note that, as always, complimentary tickets are subject to venue capacity. So if a show is sold-out, then the complimentary ticket can not be redeemed for that show. Cheers to another 22 years -- hopefully. **Did you do THIS Show? I’ve produced and booked a lot of shows and not only at Jack Rabbits. We've made a limited and partial list* here .  If you're wondering if a show is one of mine, then email JaxLiveMusic with band name(s), the venue and the year. Thanks to storm damage at both our home and Jack Rabbits there are big gaps in our written records before 2010. With a name and a year or venue then I can verify that it was my show. But after tens of thousands of shows over thirty plus years, clues really help! From 1987 to 1999 I did thousands of shows in Southern California including Pearl Jam, Blur, Korn, Kid Rock and Tool. From 1998 to present, I've done shows in Jacksonville, St. Augustine and Tallahassee. With rare exception, all the shows at Jack Rabbits and Freebird Live were mine. In addition, I've produced shows at over 20 other venues including St. Augustine Amphitheatre, Florida Theatre and 1904 Music Hall."

I particularly referenced protest signs from this era to spark a discussion of why they’re still relevant more than 50 years later. I want to show that far too often we look back at that time as if it was centuries ago, when in fact it’s a fight that’s ongoing.Adeshola Makinde  is an artist based in Chicago, Illinois.

Tanya has also appeared in print work including the cover of San Diego’s North County Pages and featured in several San Diego Union lifestyle and fitness articles.   NCDA is more than just a dance studio.  It is the culmination of the McKay’s passion and is representative of their life’s work having advanced so many students over the years, some of whom (like the authors writing this) never leave because we love them and what the studio brings to our lives so much.  NCDA is a place for children and adults of all abilities from first steps to professional performers to accomplish their personal best and develop strong self-esteem in warm, welcoming  and nurturing environment.  For many of the students, the studio is a home away from home where hugs are abundant and given freely, creativity and self-expression are encouraged, lifelong friendships are formed, acceptance is a given and personal achievements and self-growth realized.  From these authors’ perspective and we are sure other students’ as well, standing in a tap line with Louis McKay in his signature red tap shoes, hands on hips, sass oozing is an experience like no other and is one of many that has captured all of our hearts.  Their commitment to their students is unwavering  and resolute.  But wait - there’s so much more to share about the McKays.  In 2001, Louis and Tanya established Dance Hearts, a 501 (c) 3 public charity known as Bells of Freedom (www.bellsoffreedom.org) supporting our US military men and women and their families throughout the year.  100% of the funds raised go to the charity.  Louis and Tanya take nothing for themselves, not even to cover overhead costs and other expenses.  They work tirelessly at connecting in-service military men and women to the community they serve in the form of holiday “family” adoptions, emergency support and the development of transitional housing for the many women and children displaced due to adverse situation such that they can no longer remain in military housing.  Each year, they serve over 100 military families which accounts for assisting approximately 800 military men, women and children.We have all witnessed and been affected by the adverse impact on small businesses from COVID-19 over the last many months.  Despite being shut down with minimal ability to generate income, business expenses have and continue to accumulate.  The good news is, these uncertain times give us the opportunity to band together and give back to 2 very special people who have touched the lives of so many and who give so generously of themselves every single day.  Louis and Tanya are real life Angels. They are OUR FAMILY and they need us.  While every measure is being taken to make the 2020 virtual recital a reality, the current circumstances around COVID continue to create uncertainty.  That said, SHOW MUST AND WILL GO ON!  However, current restrictions and the looming possibility of potential future shutdowns mean no one has been working at capacity and may not be for quite some time.  So, if you are in a position to support NCDA we will be extremely grateful to receive your financial help.  If you could let others know about this campaign who may also be in a position to contribute, that too is greatly appreciated.Thank you in advance to all of you who have taken the time to read this and for your donations.See you on the dance floor and as Louis says at the end of every class when we take a bow; “Ladies, Gentlemen, We Love Ya Baby! God Bless.”

Courage Takes Community: Students in Solidarity with their Working Class, BIPOC Classmates.On behalf of the 24 Frames Animation Club, the Black Brilliance Club, the Students of Color Coalition, Student Council, CCA Student Union, we ask for your donations to support our working-class and BIPOC classmates.We have teamed up to catalyze the change necessary to make our school viable for all of its students. The astronomical cost of living in the Bay Area combined with an annual tuition of over $50,000 make it nearly insurmountable for many to attend, let alone thrive, at CCA.  'CCA's student body is 14% Asian American, 13% Hispanic/Latinx, and 4% African American' —an unacceptable disconnect between higher education and the BIPOC artist community in the Bay Area.During this time of COVID and a global Black Lives Matter Civil Rights movement, these students are particularly vulnerable. With your help, we can remove some of the hurdles they face in meeting their living expenses and buying art supplies.All proceeds will go toward unrestricted grants to working-class and BIPOC students to meet their most pressing needs to remain in school. Our goal is to provide a grant to every qualified student that applies.The arts have always been closely intertwined with social change and are vital for community engagement through sharing information, envisioning a peaceful and just society, and most importantly, humanizing voices and fears that are often unheard. Creativity takes courage and courage takes community. Be part of the community that uplifts the BIPOC community in the most visibly vibrant way possible and support our effort! Thank you!We are now fiscally sponsored by SOMArts based in San Francisco. ""SOMArts leverages the power of art as a tool for social change through multi-disciplinary events and exhibitions.

My name is Vanessa McDuffie—I’m a special education teacher, a writer, local creative and a community advocate from Minneapolis. As a dark skinned queer femme womxn living in the Midwest, I’ve had to carve out my own representation along my journey to self acceptance.  It hasn’t been easy, but my community has looked out for me in ways that I will forever be grateful for.Representation has come a long way since the time I was searching for it in so many white spaces..

But it needs to go further...I’m ready to carve out another piece of it. Not for me, but for the queer folx coming up behind.

NUE BEDFORD is an art gallery DEVOTED to uplifting the QUEER BIPOC voices of Minneapolis. The idea is to have a unified space to house local art of the queer community in a safe, loving, supportive environment. It’s this generation’s job to continue the goal of visibility for our queer siblings so they can see themselves sooner than we did.

This is a dream I’ve had my entire life. My existence is devoted to the art world and community service of Minnesota, and I intend to do my part to highlight the queer BIPOC artists who want space to express and my the world brighter. 

Community & allies: please help make this big  dream become a reality. 

We need a space!! Help us make it possible to rent a space to (eventually!) create workshops, pop up shops, gallery events and networking opportunities for an inclusive Minneapolis art scene. As of now, funds will go to the following:-space to rent-website and logo-marketing budget -events budget 

We’re starting slow—we need a space, but it won’t be physically     available to the public until the end of the year (due to Covid). But there’s plenty of work to do before then.

My name is Maddy Walsh, and I’m the front person of Ithaca, New York based, nationally touring moxy rock band Maddy Walsh & The Blind Spots. I hope you’re all surviving these very tumultuous times in whatever ways you can. The band is embarking on this fundraising campaign in an effort to stay afloat during the pandemic and quarantine while we’re unable to perform live shows, but since we're all living in what I've heard described as a ""pandemic within a pandemic"" and the ""fever dream"" that is 2020, I want to first address the widespread financial need brought on not only by COVID-19 but by the recent murder of George Floyd and so many others at the hands of police officers. There are many organizations and fundraisers that can use your immediate support before you choose to support the arts (to support us), and here are the few I have personally donated to over the past couple months:The Bail Project:https://bailproject.org/The Southside Community Center:https://sspride.org/The American Civil Liberties Union (ALCU):https://action.aclu.org/give/fund-every-fight-aheadThe fund for Gianna Floyd, George Perry Floyd’s daughter:https://www.gofundme.com/f/gianna-floyd-daughter-of-george-floyd-fundJustice for Breonna Taylor:https://www.gofundme.com/f/9v4q2-justice-for-breonna-taylorThis list is inexhaustible, and you can find so many more places to allocate your support for our BIPOC / PGM communities. Check out The Lit. Bar: Bookstore & Chill, a black-owned bookstore with a great selection; do the research and find your local black-owned businesses and, if you have it, support them with MONEY, not just shares on social media. Alongside you, I’m listening in and learning better ways to support and serve the Black Lives Matter movement and how to put the nail in the coffin of Systemic Racism in America. If you're lucky enough to still be working or to have received government assistance during this time, I urge you to throw your support there FIRST. And if you have more to give and want to support the arts, here’s a thorough [very long, sorry] description of what we’re trying to do to stay afloat.   In almost-twelve years as a band, The Blind Spots have remained self-funded and have never reached out to our fans in order to pay for recordings, videos, advertising, tours, or our tour vehicle. We have paid for everything we have by saving money from ticket sales and merchandise, and we would always prefer to do our job to make money. We actually took an early and pretty firm stance against crowd-sourcing at the onset of websites like Kickstarter and GoFundMe because we feared that so many people trying to fund their artistic projects would over-saturate the market and over-burden potential donors, making them feel burnt out and unable to donate to campaigns to help, for example, cancer patients trying to cover chemo treatments; parents of disabled children in need a wheelchair ramp, and now, fundraisers like the one for George Floyd’s daughter.*This is not a criticism of our fellow artists who have successfully crowd-sourced in order to fund their artistic endeavors; it was just a personal choice we made as a band, but it was also one we made before these platforms became more nuanced. Now artists are able to offer incentives for different levels of donations, which sometimes means simply pre-ordering the album a musician is trying to get funded; receiving merch packages; tickets or guest list slots to future shows, etc. By offering incentives, this platform feels less like we’re just asking for money, since there is an exchange.I’ve wondered for years whether it’s the right thing to do to be honest and open with fans about our costs, because we’re in entertainment. I’m honored and take very seriously the fact that you spend your hard-earned money on our shows, albums, and merchandise; through the music you should be uplifted and transported temporarily away from everyday stresses. I’ve been afraid that once you know that behind the curtain there’s deeply distressing financial worry, it will take away from the magic of that experience for you, and I want your experience of our music to remain pure. But entertainers or not, we’re struggling beside you during these unprecedented times, so we’ve decided to reach out and let you know how you can help us. After our  instruments and music equipment, our van is the single most important tool we depend on in order to function. It hauls our gear in a trailer behind it, it’s how we get to the shows where we do what defines us and our business, and the shows themselves are what make us money to continue being a band. The van also makes up the largest part of our overhead. After a struggle straddling several months trying to get our last van repaired (details below), we purchased a new van in January, and now due to COVID-19, we cannot go on tour or play shows for the foreseeable future in order to make our monthly payments of $853 ($687/month on our loan and $175/month in insurance.)Suave and I have put on a couple virtual performances since this quarantine began, and we’re grateful for every donation fans have made to the band for those concerts. (We’ll continue to do these kinds of things, but sitting in our living room, just the two of us, and playing to you through a screen isn’t the same. We have a band for a reason! We love the energy we can bring to a stage with a full five-piece. We miss it, and we miss you.) This effort is a more focused campaign, specifically aimed at easing the financial burden of having a new van that we just bought and now can’t use in order to go out and earn. We’re still not sure when it will be safe to play live again, and even once it’s declared relatively safe, possibly meaning we can gather for a show but should still wear masks and dance six feet apart, it may not feel the same for a long time. Also, with regard to touring, (which is the main reason to have a van and trailer), many shows are booked six to twelve months out, so once we’re in the clear, there will be an inevitable scheduling period before we can hit the road again. This all leaves us on very shaky ground.   The band’s entire financial burden will be lifted and our future will not be in jeopardy if:23 people donate $2,000 each!...or 46 people donate $1,000 each!...or 91 people donate $500 each!...or 182 people donate $250 each!...or 302 people donate $150 each!...or 454 people donate $100 each! ...or 907 people donate $50 each!Numbuhs!We’re offering various incentives for different donation levels, and we hugely appreciate any support you can offer to help us get this van paid off so we can rest easier while we’re waiting to be able to play music for you again.Incentives:$10: Any Blind Spots CD$25: T-shirt (spring green with violet and cream MW&TBS logo)$50: Merch Pack of all four CDs, two bumper stickers, & sunglasses $150: Zoom-a-Gram! We'll learn a song of your choosing and set up a Zoom with you and a friend to play it for them live (virtually); or we can record it and send it to you to do with it whatever you please. We're happy to include a dedication.$400: Wine Tour! You and up to four friends can be driven around Cayuga or Seneca Lake in said VAN from 11am to 5pm from winery to winery with members of MW&TBS as your drivers and chauffeurs. *Please be flexible with your schedule; we want everyone to feel comfortable and safe, so this may have to wait until NYS has been given the green light to do things like this again.$500: One-hour acoustic house concert. *Again, please be flexible with the scheduling due to NYS social distancing recommendations. $1,500: Full-On Moxy Rock Show at Your Place. *Same scheduling request as above.$5,000: Tickets for Life(Guest list spots to any MW&TBS show, or any show of mine or Suave's for life.) *We're happy to discuss other options with you if you have additional ideas, and if you have a local business that would like to donate, we could explore some cross-promotional opportunities ~ let's swap swag!

*We're also happy to share the saga of the van and why we're fundraising this strange number. The story is long and boring and annoying, but if you're donating and want to understand the whole picture, you're welcome to the nitty gritty details: https://www.theblindspots.com/index.php/damn-the-vanAgain, please donate to any of the fundraisers and organizations I mentioned above before you donate to us. There are so many important ones, especially right now, so feel free to share here in the comments where you’re putting your support so other fanimals can see and learn from you. I personally don’t want to live in a world without art; bare-bones survival mode isn’t enough for me. Human beings are capable of creating such beauty in the face of tragedy, and that act of celebration is what makes us and our world worth fighting for. I’ve taken this time away from performing and seeing live shows to tie up years of loose ends, to plant gardens, and to reflect deeply on what is most important to me so that when we re-emerge from this time apart and gather again, I’ll bring my very best to our big family table, and to the stage too. I love you all. Thank you for being here with me. Love,Maddy

Dear friends, IAF family and dance communityIt is with a heavy heart but one full of hope that I write this message. Like so many small studio owners, the COVID-19 pandemic has brought unforeseen challenges, new obstacles, and has forced us to temporarily shut our doors. Today, with Los Angeles being one of the hardest hit areas and the pandemic still raging on, it pains me to announce that this has led to the closure of our IAF Compound.MY STORY:When I first moved to Los Angeles eight years ago to compete on So You Think You Can Dance, I was inspired not only by the talent that is attracted to LA, but also the diverse and supportive dance community that I was becoming a part of. Knowing that not all dancers could afford private academies, I created IAF with the intention of helping young dancers find their passion and to help older dancers forge their unique talents into artistry. Two years ago, I opened the IAF Compound in North Hollywood to provide a safe and welcoming space for dancers to explore their own creativity, refine their technique, and collaborate with one another. It has been a journey filled with so much love and passion that I have poured just as much of my heart and soul into IAF as you all have.COVID IMPACT:Before COVID-19 hit, I decided to invest in a new state of the art sprung flooring system by Harlequin Floors. For me, this immense financial undertaking was an important step towards being a responsible studio owner. Unfortunately, it has added to the mounting financial burdens this pandemic has brought on.As a result I have no choice but to let go of the current space. While the IAF Compound will be officially closing its doors in September, I am doing everything in my power to keep my vision for this brand alive. In a last effort to save IAF, I decided to downsize to a smaller, more affordable space for the time being, in hopes that we can continue providing the dance community with classes and programs. THE ASK:I am turning to the most extraordinary people I know. You who inspire me. You who collaborate with me. You who grow with me. And you who make this all possible. In launching this campaign, I am hoping to not only recuperate from the financial losses IAF has experienced, but to open our doors even wider for our dance community to recover in the months to come. My hope is that this campaign will allow us to continue to create, educate and inspire! Despite the uncertainty of the future, the IAF Team has remained committed to our mission of providing high-quality dance training and a creative outlet. We are continuing to develop new ways of reaching our dancers through our online platform, IAF Prime. With our new, downsized location, we will be able to film and produce content for dancers. It will also provide dancers with a space to return to their craft once the pandemic has passed. The future of the IAF is at stake, but I have faith that with your support, we will be able to see this through. Any donation, no matter the amount, would be greatly and sincerely appreciated. Every single donation will get us one step closer to opening our doors.OUR GOAL:Our goal is to raise $155,000.This number largely reflects our operational costs and monetary loss as a result of the pandemic. Additionally, it reflects the funds needed to support our promise to the dance community:IAF PLEDGE:If we reach our goal of raising $155,000,  IAF pledges to be the first LA dance studio to offer free dance training for all  dancers who donate to our cause.**See donation tier breakdown belowOur mission is to use this campaign as a means to support dancers that can’t afford classes and quality training due to months of being out of work. As we receive your support, we feel it is imperative to do our part in giving back and helping the dance community get back on its feet.I want to thank everyone who has stood by IAF during these difficult times. I will continue to work tirelessly on maintaining IAF as a stronghold for creativity and artistry within the dance community. Your support means the world to me and I hope that I can continue to pay it forward.With the utmost gratitude,Chehon Wespi-TschoppEXPENSE BREAKDOWN:LOSS: $73,253 (INCLUDES RENT, UTILITIES, STAFF AND TEACHER PAY DURING 5 MONTHS OF SHUT DOWN)MONTHLY EXPENSES: $18,700 / MONTH (INCLUDES RENT, UTILITIES, STAFF AND TEACHER PAY)DONATION BREAKDOWN: *Complimentary class cards include IAF OPEN MASTER CLASSES*All classes, including IAF OPEN MASTER CLASSES, are redeemable through December 31, 2021Up to $99 Donation:IF WE REACH OUR GOAL, YOU GET: Complimentary 1 month class card$100 Donation: GUARANTEED: Complimentary 1 month class card (Up to 12 free classes)IF WE REACH OUR GOAL, YOU GET:  Complimentary 2 month class card (Up to 24 free classes)$300 Donation: GUARANTEED: Complimentary 2 month class card (Up to 24 free classes)IF WE REACH OUR GOAL, YOU GET: Complimentary 3 month class card (Up to 36 free classes)$500 Donation:GUARANTEED:- Complimentary 2 month class card (Up to 24 free classes)- Priority registration for all IAF Master classes- Redeemable until December 2021IF WE REACH OUR GOAL, YOU GET: - Complimentary 3 month class card (Up to 36 free classes)- Priority registration for all IAF Master classes- Redeemable until December 2021$1,000 Donation: GUARANTEED:- FIRST 10 PEOPLE TO DONATE AT THIS TIER WILL RECEIVE PRIVATE MASTER CLASS WITH ONE OF OUR IAF  CHOREOGRAPHERS- Complimentary 2 month class card (Up to 24 free classes)- Priority registration in all IAF master classes- Redeemable until December 2021IF WE REACH OUR GOAL, YOU GET:- FIRST 10 PEOPLE TO DONATE AT THIS TIER WILL RECEIVE PRIVATE MASTER CLASS WITH ONE OF OUR IAF CHOREOGRAPHERS- Complimentary 3 month class card (Up to 36 free classes)- Priority registration in all IAF master classes- Redeemable until December 2021$2,500 Donation: GUARANTEED:- NAME ADDED TO OUR DONOR RECOGNITION WALL, DISPLAYED IN OUR NEW STUDIO SPACE- FIRST 10 PEOPLE TO DONATE AT THIS TIER WILL RECEIVE PRIVATE MASTER CLASS WITH ONE OF OUR IAF CHOREOGRAPHERS- Complimentary 2 month class card (Up to 24 free classes)- Priority registration in all IAF master classes- Redeemable until December 2021- One VIP ticket to any IAF performance or showcase for the 2020/2021 seasonIF WE REACH OUR GOAL, YOU GET:- NAME ADDED TO OUR DONOR RECOGNITION WALL, DISPLAYED IN OUR NEW STUDIO SPACE- FIRST 10 PEOPLE TO DONATE AT THIS TIER WILL RECEIVE PRIVATE MASTER CLASS WITH ONE OF OUR IAF CHOREOGRAPHERS-Complimentary 3 month class card (Up to 36 free classes)-Priority registration in all IAF master classes- Redeemable until December 2021-One VIP ticket to any IAF performance or showcase for the 2020/2021 season$5,000 Donation:GUARANTEED:- NAME ADDED TO OUR DONOR RECOGNITION WALL, DISPLAYED IN OUR NEW STUDIO SPACE- FIRST 10 PEOPLE TO DONATE AT THIS TIER WILL RECEIVE PRIVATE MASTER CLASS WITH ONE OF OUR IAF CHOREOGRAPHERS- Complimentary 2 month class card (Up to 24 free classes)- Redeemable until December 2021- Priority registration in all IAF master classes- Redeemable until December 2021- Two VIP tickets to any IAF performance or showcase for the 2020/2021 season- Private studio tour with IAF Director Chehon prior to re-openingIF WE REACH OUR GOAL, YOU GET:-NAME ADDED TO OUR DONOR RECOGNITION WALL, DISPLAYED IN OUR NEW STUDIO SPACE-FIRST 10 PEOPLE TO DONATE AT THIS TIER WILL RECEIVE PRIVATE MASTER CLASS WITH ONE OF OUR IAF CHOREOGRAPHERS- Complimentary 3 month class card (Up to 36 free classes)- Redeemable until December 2021- Priority registration in all IAF master classes- Redeemable until December 2021- Two VIP tickets to any IAF performance or showcase for the 2020/2021 season- Private studio tour with IAF Director Chehon prior to re-openingIf you wish to donate above our listed donation tiers, please reach out to us at admin @ iamforce . com  to receive information on our elite donor packages.

What was to be a season filled with rejoicing, would quickly turn into our biggest struggle. The year promised to be one of celebration where friends old & new would rejoice in the plays, actors, and community events that have made the Aurora Arts Theatre what it is today. Eddie Chapa realized his dream of establishing a theatre in 2010, but sadly, he was only able to see its success for one short year, as he passed away in February of 2011. While that was a devastating day for all of us, I found comfort in knowing the happiness that the theatre brought to his life. While I felt the overwhelming love of Eddie’s family and my own, I soon realized I had yet another family I could turn to — my theatre family. They rallied around me, and the theatre soon became my refuge. With the tremendous encouragement and support I received from the community, I realized that the theatre had not only been my refuge, but also the refuge for many who also found solace, cheer, and a sense of belonging at the Aurora.The Aurora has been fortunate to be a part of such a great community for the past 10 years. When we produce a play or a musical, we instantly become a part of something much bigger than the production itself. We renew and create friendships, share ideas, comfort those in need, and share a burst of laughter that just seems to make our day. Whether it be watching or participating in a play, volunteering, or simply having conversations across the concession counter with our great volunteers, the Aurora certainly satisfies a need. The theatre has a unique way of providing a safe space for all and helping those who enter feel right at home. We are always honored and privileged when you, our community, include us in your special moments such as weddings, baptismal celebrations, birthdays, graduations, etc. We look forward to being able to share those celebrations and experiences once again. But now, the Aurora Arts Theatre is in danger of closing its doors forever. The pandemic has affected us all, and while we continue with different activities such as curbside popcorn, cinema nights, t-shirt sales, etc. to bring in revenue, it is just not enough. While these activities do help, they are not sufficient to cover the mounting expenses each month. We know that many find themselves in the same plight as we navigate our emotional struggles and financial constraints, and we are uncertain about what the future holds. The Aurora also faces seemingly insurmountable struggles as restrictions placed on venues such as the Aurora have resulted in significant financial loss. We are humbled by friends that have already contributed to the theatre — you fill our hearts. Now, the Aurora Arts Theatre humbly asks family, friends, and community to help us get through this terrible time. Please know that any contribution is greatly appreciated and will be used to help keep our doors open as we look forward to the day when we can once again call “places” and experience the wonder of live theatre.

On July 5, 2020 heaven gained an angel when our beloved, Michael Mudge (37 years old), died tragically in a car crash in San Diego, CA. Mike is survived by his 1 year old son, mother, brother, amazing friends and loving family members who would do anything in the world to see his smile and hear his voice again. He was his mother’s rock, his brother’s best friend, and loved more than anything in the world being a father to his one year old son, Rowan. While Mike left the Earth too soon, he will always be remembered for his one-of-a-kind, selfless, larger than life personality. Mike had the biggest heart for kids, dogs, adventures, and life. He was everyone’s friend, loved to listen, learn, help, and especially talk.

And Portland, Oregon & NYC have been in the national spotlight  for the last several weeks as examples of the brutal, disproportionate response from the local, state and federal government toward the civil rights protestors of the Black Lives Matter movement. Now, Moms United for Black Lives both Portland and New York City chapters are looking to take that tenacity to Washington DC to advocate for their communities and build solidarity on behalf of their cities during the upcoming August 28th March on DC. New York took note of the hardship faced by the Black community in Portland, because that struggle is not unlike the struggle in NYC. Now, these two cities are joining together in solidarity to amplify one another's work. This bicoastal team of activists and organizers will be uniting for the March on Washington DC on the 57th anniversary of  Martin Luther King’s march on our nation’s capital.  These activists are leaders in their communities; they deserve the opportunity to exercise their rights and speak truth to power in Washington DC. Let's help them get there. Money will be used for:-Roundtrip airfare from PDX & NYC to DC (expensive this close to the date)-Rental cars-Lodging accommodations -Appropriate PPE -Food Extra funds will be shared in mutual aid for community to assist with:  -Hospital expenses-Legal expenses-Housing costs-Food-TransportationOregon has a long history of white supremacy and racism . It was illegal to be Black in the state until 1926 , less than 100 years ago. This racist history permeates everything from public policy to policing. It also greatly informed how the city of Portland came to be “the whitest city in America ” a moniker that still applies today. Daily life as a Black American living in Portland & NYC is –in itself– an act of resistance. According to the most recent census , Oregon’s population is nearly 87% white with only 2.2% being Black or African American and Portland  is 77% white with a 5.8% Black or African American population. So it’s no surprise that the white majority has maintained the below status quo treatment of Black residents and that the Black Lives Matter movement here has been met with such a violent response from elected officials. The ongoing fight for racial justice in Portland & NYC is the fight for racial justice everywhere. These activists are ready to further amplify the voices of their community to a national audience at the march on DC. Please donate today to help these Black revolutionaries take this fight for Black Lives straight to DC’s doorstep. Your support is critical to amplifying the ongoing work and voices of these Black activists who have been doing this work their entire lives. It’s also crucial to sustaining the pressure for systemic change and momentum for Black Lives Matter. No justice. No peace.

Hi all,Yesterday on Juneteenth, we held a glorious 12 hr celebration of our ancestors and our freedom.  Despite gofundme hindering our access to these funds for whatever reasons. We still managed to cover the following expenses from yesterday's event. - Facilitators who were paid 300 each and will be retroactively paid additional funds when we are given access. - Caterers, who provided individually packaged meals for lunch and dinner with various options to accommodate dietary restrictions. -  A DJ, Pa system, speakers, and a generator for the duration of the event plus one tech person to man the PA all day and attend to any issues as they came up. - All manner of supplies that weren't donated, such as art supplies tables, chairs, ect. - Y-WE trained affinity leaders who led volunteers and facilitated a virtual de-escalation training for all non-black allies that were on the ground as support all day.- Candles, blankets, and other trinkets for both the ancestor's altar and the releasing altar made available to participants during the grief circle. - A black film team to allow our participants to individually share their stories of black healing and liberation. *We are happy to report that we fully supported/paid all-black facilitators and businesses for all of our event needs and staff. We are so grateful to the organizations and people who supported us with donations of masks, supplies, first-aid kits, onsite medics, pastries, snacks, water bottles, fruit,  our CHOP family and our recruited ally team who attended the training and showed up with gentle ferocity to hold the space and educate those who showed up to challenge the necessity of all black healing spaces. The remaining funds will be used to cover two more event days centering healing for the black community which will take place on June 26th and 27th from 9 am-8 pm.  Again we will use the funds to cover the following:- 15 Black facilitators for art circles, grief rituals, writing circles, herbalist,  yoga, meditation, collective altar building, peace circles, orisha dance sessions etc. - To pay a professional photographer to cover both days events.- Art supplies, flower crown building supplies. - film editors to piece together the healing black stories collected. - film people for the healing black story booth round 2- Y-WE affinity leaders to train allies and serve as support staff for the duration of both events. - caterers for breakfast, lunch, and dinner on both, days. - gift bags to thank the facilitators.  -website and graphic designer to make information about facilitators, organizers, and events easier to find. - and any additional related expenses that arise. *again we will be supporting black-owned business and people with all the funds (Reparations we raised for this event). For inquiring minds who would like to know here's a bit of information about the organizers1. Mary Hall-Williams: I am a 25yr old University of Washington student. I study Medical Anthropology and Global Health, maintain a 4.0 and am conducting honors research on ""Intentional and Automatic Coping Mechanisms in Response to Viral Black Death and Racism. I am a former youth Pastor. I have worked in the past with African American Reach and Teach Health Ministry (AFRATH ) on community health initiatives and sustainability and gardening initiatives for youth including the formation of a community garden and art mural. As a lead teacher at The Good Shepherd's Childcare Center. As a teacher and youth leader at Medhane-Alem Ethiopian Church of Seattle. and with youth organized homeless outreach in downtown Seattle. It's deeply irritating that we are being asked to further prove ourselves and our competence to get funds released as if our previous explanation wasn't enough. 2. Reagan Jackson (co-organizer and Director at Y-WE lead) is amazing. If you don't know about Y-WE lead I encourage you to google them and support this amazing non-profit that continues to support youth in Seattle.  Further, she is an awarded author, who has penned books, facilitates writing classes, writes columns and thinks pieces, recently taught a class at Seattle University, and who believed that we could pull off an event in 72hrs and then spent 14hrs with me out on the ground making it happen. Additionally, I would like to offer a radical reminder that black women do not owe you an explanation and that we appreciate the ways you supported not only the Amazing healing space that we made happen in 72hrs on limited energy while also working our regular job shifts and managing being human beings, but also the ways you support the black community at all times by being allies and doing the anti-racist work necessary to make the words ""all black healing space"" less controversial. Thank you to those who have donated and thank you in advance to gofundme for releasing the funds instead of being a further hindrance to what we are building for our community in a time where the hypervisibility of black death and racism are exasperated and causing the black community daily emotional distress.

Since then, we have been working diligently to make sure President Trumps re-election is a success. Unfortunately, we have had to face some major obstacles with our vehicle and the bridge. We have traveled to all 48 continental states with hopes and dreams of one day making it to Alaska and Hawaii. Our truck was taken through a high speed chase after being stolen and resulted in a crash. It was driven over curbs and through trees. It resulted in extensive damage. The truck has already had 4 engine replacement and now needs another.  The transmission had to be replaced and the truck just really needs to be upgraded. It is critical that we have reliable transportation so we can keep traveling all around the United States and keep our message of support and appreciation  to  President Trump going. With the election just weeks away it is more important than ever, that we are on the road helping to reassure that President Trumps re-election efforts are a success.

On July 20, June was fired from her job as a senior pastor. We are building a team around June and her family as they prepare for an uncertain future. As part of Team June, you can help alleviate some financial burdens during this time of transition. Help June with the expenses of life as she moves into this next chapter of her story so she is free to do so slowly and steadily, in wholeness and with boldness.We, her friends, have set an ambitious goal because we want to anticipate both short-term and long-term needs. We know her influence has already been far-reaching, and we trust your generosity and support will be as well. No matter what we raise, the whole of it will reach June and will speak to her of our tremendous love for her and our belief in this next chapter of her story.If you're still reading and would like to know a little more, particularly about that ambitious goal, we believe that living as her authentic self may cost June a livelihood for some time--beyond any benefits or severance she may receive. She is a great pastor and an excellent preacher, but we know that full-time pastorates for trans women are few and far between. In fact, transgender individuals in Ontario face three times the national unemployment rate, according to transequalitycanada.com. In June's sermon on June 14, she preached about holding this precious pearl, and brilliantly shared her story with the world. We know that living as their authentic selves costs too many trans people everything, and June's bold life is one we are all so lucky to witness. By contributing to Team June, you are helping to make your love known by alleviating some of the enormous costs of life.

****wow! Goal met, but let’s keep going!! The more we raise the bigger and better the celebration❤️ you all are amazing!!
*** if we go over our goal, 100% of all raised goes back into the event and just means more surprises for our seniors!! 
Help the 2020 Seniors of Tesoro have a Celebratory Event!!!These unprecedented times have been tough on all of us, especially our Tesoro 2020 Seniors.  While our district is still trying to plan a graduation date to honor our children in July, we wanted to do something to celebrate them on their original graduation date of June 4th, 2020. While our district and school cannot sponsor our event, our event will not be prevented. With much orchestration, we are celebrating our seniors on June 4th, 2020 with a Senior Celebratory Car Parade from 3:00-5:00. This is not a graduation or taking the place of any other CUSD event. Again, this is NOT a Tesoro or CUSD sponsored event. Our small committee is working with an event company to help plan and operate this event. This drive-thru celebratory car parade will follow all traffic and social distancing guidelines. No exiting from their vehicles allowed. The event company is running the event and providing all signage and cones, traffic staffing, production staff, and celebratory surprises. We have over 600 seniors and we need this company to assist us in making the event a success. We must raise ALL funds for this event to occur for our children. Any amount helps and will be greatly appreciated!"

In the spirit of being their ""Sister Diamonds"" - as only a diamond can cut another diamond - we want the opportunity to ""cut"" over 2,500 black girls from ages 18-25, in college, grad school, or recent graduates by providing a scholarship to attend the event.  Forget the ordinary online Zoom meeting! We're anticipating that over 10,000 attendees will enter the virtual world of the International Slumber Party, where all ""clicks"" will lead to the door of our virtual ISP mansion, the digital venue where the entire event will take place. Funds will also go to support the technology, production, and marketing of the event.  BLACK GIRLS MATTER!

To address the civic need of African American Angelenos, Fannie Williams and Della Williams, wife of world-renowned architect Paul Williams, with 50 enterprising women purchased the Wilfandel, a Revival Mediterranean style house. The Wilfandel members celebrated their club’s tenth anniversary by paying off their $28,000 mortgage. They envisioned the house for individuals of all races and ethnicities to participate in civic events and family celebrations. This campaign is a collaborative effort of the multi-generational prominent African American women members who strive to continue its legacy of community outreach through civic betterment, philanthropic endeavors, scholarship and cultural enrichment. The ClubhouseIs located in the West Adams Terrace Historic Preservation Zone in Los Angeles, California and was built in 1912. The two story, 6254 sq. ft. house has 5 bedrooms, 4 baths and gardens on an expansive 18,000 sq. ft. corner lot. A detached garage is topped by a two-bedroom guest apartment. This 75-year old organization is one of the few surviving historical black organizations in Los Angeles to continue to own property as the process of gentrification has changed the demographics of the surrounding community and erased cultural enclaves. The Wilfandel members recognize the importance of preserving the century old structure and participate in fundraising efforts that include creation of a Donor Wall, annual cultural events and grant solicitation.  As a result of the system upgrades and the  ‘shelter in place’ ordinance issued by Los Angeles Governor Newsom, the Wilfandel has been closed since January 1,2020 and has lost essential operational revenue.  Help Continue the Wilfandel’s legacy. It Matters! The funds raised by “Our Black Legacy Matters: The Wilfandel Preservation and Legacy Campaign” will ensure that the clubhouse continues to remain a valued and respected resource and expands its ability to serve the community. The Wilfandel Club seeks funds to renovate a two-bedroom guest apartment and to create a commercial kitchen; to improve, maintain and preserve the structure; and to cover operating expenses. BudgetOur campaign goal is to raise $250,000.General operations - $30,000Preservation - $50,000Renovation - $170,000 #Wilfandellegacy#Blackwomenmatter#Blackscholarship#Blackcivicengagement#Blacklegacy#Blackwomenempowerment Campaign DetailsWho We Are, What We Do and Why it Matters!Until the mid 1940’s racial covenants prevented African Americans access to public facilities. As a result, blacks were not able to join celebrations, attend seminars or participate in cultural events held at public locations . To address the needs of African American Angelenos, Fannie Williams and Della Williams, wife of world-renowned architect Paul Williams, with 50 enterprising women purchased the Wilfandel, a Revival Mediterranean style house. They envisioned the house for individuals of all races and ethnicities to participate in civic events and family celebrations. This campaign is a collaborative effort of the multi-generational African American women Wilfandel members who range in age from 45 to 95. We represent a wide spectrum of industries and professions with high station in government, executive positions in academia and executive positions in the private sector.  We joined the Wilfandel to preserve its legacy of community outreach through civic betterment, philanthropic endeavors, scholarship and cultural enrichment.  We share fond memories of attending art exhibits, book signings, poetry readings, workshops, seminars, lectures, rituals, celebrations and civic meetings with our family, members of the community and noteworthy individuals at the Wilfandel. Other professional and nonprofit organizations also schedule events at the stunning edifice. Over the decades, the Susan B. Komen Foundation, Language Immersion Charter School, Albert McNeil Jubilee Singers, LA Association of Black Professionals and St. Bridget Catholic Church have held exquisite events at the house. As a nonprofit, the Wilfandel offers reduced rental rates to similar organizations. Wilfandel Club Challenges Racial CovenantsIn 1945 the 50 visionary, trailblazing African American women purchased the house after raising funds for the down payment over a 3-year period. The ladies celebrated their club’s tenth anniversary with the payoff of their $28,000 mortgage secured by Broadway Federal, a minority owned bank. Comparable properties in the West Adams neighborhood, one of the oldest in the City of Los Angeles and known for its large number of historic buildings, structures and notable mansions, are now valued at over $1.5 million. The ClubhouseIs located in the West Adams Terrace Historic Preservation Overlay Zone (HPOZ), in Los Angeles, California and was built in 1912. The two story, 6254 sq. ft. house has 5 bedrooms, 4 baths and gardens on an expansive 18,000 sq. ft. corner lot. A detached garage is topped by a two-bedroom guest apartment. The ground floor houses the club’s business office, a large kitchen and dining area, the lanai and the public rooms used for countless meetings, lectures, concerts and charitable activities. On the upper floor are the separate ‘Bride’ and ‘Groom’ suites and a conference room. Although the Wilfandel is not a historically designated landmark, it is highly regarded by the Los Angeles Conversancy, the largest preservation organization in the United States. Located in the preservation zone signifies that the house has historic, architectural, cultural or aesthetic significance. The Wilfandel is currently reviewing the requirements of the City of Los Angeles Cultural Heritage commission to determine if the house will qualify as a Los Angeles Cultural Monument due to its historical significance during the period of restrictive covenants. 75-Year Legacy of Cultural SignificanceThe club provides people of all races and cultures affordable access to an elegant venue for social and civic activities. We recognize the importance of remaining relevant as the demographics of the surrounding community continue to change. Over the years the nonprofit has been vital to the civic infrastructure of LA’s black community. Recognition of the historic legacy of the West Adams community and the ability to respond to the needs of the surrounding areas, are essential to the future of The Wilfandel Club. Limited Black Homeownership and GentrificationIncome inequality, limited inter-generational wealth, and discriminatory lending and real estate practices contribute to the changing demographics of West Adams Terrance.  The once thriving African American community has been negatively affected by  the process of gentrification. The displacement of African American property owners  and limited resources to purchase in affluent areas have become common occurrences. The Wilfandel is one of the few surviving historical black organizations in Los Angeles to continue to own property. Wilfandel Fundraising EffortsThe members recognize preservation as a cost effective way to remain relevant in the community and have participated in several efforts to generate capital. A Donor Wall exhibits the benefactor’s names prominently displayed in the lanai.  The Wilfandel was recently awarded a grant to preserve historic African American cultural sites. The funds were allocated to make plumbing, electric and foundation upgrades to the 1912 building. The Wilfandel board decided the clubhouse would be closed January through April 2020 to complete the upgrades. Challenges: Impact of COVID-19 and Social Distancing EventsSince April when Mayor Eric Garcetti announced that Los Angeles would ‘shelter in place’ to prevent the spread of the Coronavirus, the Wilfandel has been closed.  COVID – 19 has severely affected the Wilfandel’s ability to receive essential rental revenue. As Los Angeles prepares to reopen, the members are in the process of determining how to effectively enforce social distancing at all club events. Preservation and RenovationCompleted and Remaining UpgradesThe plumbing and electrical upgrades were completed in April 2020. Given the age of the structure, the building understandably requires regular maintenance and repairs. The remaining grant funds will be used to plaster, paint and fix the crumbling foundation that was identified in a recent inspection. The board is also aware of the need to update the house to be Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) compliant. RenovationThe guest apartment over the garage has sustained significant damage and has been deemed unsafe and inhabitable. The roof, plumbing and electrical systems need repair along with the structural damage to the walls and flooring. Since affordable housing is one of Los Angeles most pressing issues, the renovation of the guesthouse could provide affordable housing to address the shortage and a source of income for the club. Additionally we envision creating a commercial kitchen out of the existing conventional one. There is no commercial kitchen available to prepare food for catered events within a 4-mile radius of the property. The kitchen could be rented out to qualified and vetted chefs as another source of income. The ProcessStructural integrity and public safety are our primary concerns.  Consistent with the Secretary of Interior’s Standards and Principles, special consideration will be given to the historic use and the original design aesthetics of the property.  All construction will adhere to local standards and all current building codes. All work will be conducted by a licensed contractor, the proper building permits will be obtained and all inspections completed and approved. BudgetOur campaign goal is to raise $250,000.General operations - $30,000Preservation - $50,000Renovation - $170,000 Help Continue the Wilfandel’s legacy. It Matters! A 2018 study conducted by the Los Angeles Conservancy Commission found that historic places contribute to the overall livability of the city and provides real value for every Angelenos.  As an historic civic organization our goals are service, sustainability, longevity and continued relevance.  The funds raised by “Our Black Legacy Matters: The Wilfandel Preservation and Legacy Campaign” will ensure that the clubhouse continues to remain a valued and respected resource and expand its ability to serve the community. The Wilfandel Club seeks funds to renovate a two-bedroom guest apartment and to create a commercial kitchen; to improve, maintain and preserve the structure; and to cover operating expenses. We seek to build our online and social media presence and to forge deeper relationships and collaborations with institutions, our neighbors and the Los Angeles community at large. We envision the clubhouse as a unique and wonderful destination for scheduled civic events throughout the year. The Wilfandel’s cultural significance legacy matters. If the club does not successfully reach our campaign goal, its 75-year presence in the community could come to an abrupt end. If that should happen, the community would lose a cultural hub, minority students accepted at 4-year universities would lose the opportunity to receive need-based scholarships, minority families and organizations would not have ready access to a distinguished and dignified, reasonably-priced venue for celebrations, rituals, and civic meetings. And another black-owned property would succumb to gentrification. Please join the Preservation and Legacy campaign!

The man who needs no introduction. Whether you call him Mark, Marky, Mr. Lipson or Slippy, you know that this man's generous heart shines in all that he does.The layers of crisis are real and very dire, but we can help lighten the load. Mark has done so much for the organic sector and this earth-connected community we call home. Now it’s our turn to show him how much we care.Over his 40 years of service, Mark has mentored and supported many of today’s organizational leaders. The list of his volunteer and community-building achievements is endless. I, Liz Birnbaum, founder and CEO of The Curated Feast, am one of the lucky mentees. I also lovingly call him my adopted California dad (though I've done that behind his back until now).You know that Mark is one of the original founders of the organic movement we have today. You know that he was the first paid employee of California Certified Organic Farmers (CCOF), and among so many other professional and community accomplishments, has been a Partner at Molino Creek Farm since 1983.But did you know that Mark is under tremendous stress and very much needs our help?As he turns 64 (what I’ll always think of as Sgt. Pepper age) on October 19th, it's not only time to reflect on this man’s tremendous gifts to the world, but it’s time to step up and support him.These funds will make it possible to:+ Repair the infrastructure of Mark and Cassandra’s home (the many parts not covered by insurance).+ Repair the domestic water and fire-fighting supply—which we know will be essential in the coming years.+ Remove approx. 500 (literal) tons of Douglas Fir tree that came down in the front yard.+ Create an additional living space for on-site help (one of Cass and Mark’s kids) for fire recovery and Cassandra’s care.+ Upgrade Mark’s vehicle, which was damaged due to the fire, so he has transportation for an upcoming wet winter. Searching for the C word(s).Mark has been his partner Cassandra's primary caregiver since her cancer diagnosis in 2019. As she completed her treatment in March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic took hold, severely hindering Mark’s ability to regain viable work. Cass now needs surgery imminently due to unforeseen rare complications.A 20-year cancer survivor himself and someone who lives with congenital heart condition that has required multiple surgeries, Mark also carries the burden of personal health concerns.Then came the fire.The CZU Complex Fires tremendously damaged the Molino Creek Farm Collective. Mark’s home was thankfully not destroyed (because of hero Bob Frank!), however the damage to the land and community was immense. Busy managing the Molino Creek Farm GoFundMe and other disaster recovery, he personally needs our support!Molino Creek is covered in ash. I went up to Molino Creek last weekend, and seeing the dome, the land, and the lines that fire burned on the homes gave me tears, goosebumps, and deep shock. The impact on the hearts and minds of the whole community cannot be overstated.Folks, these are tough times for all. The only way we’re going to get through this is by loving and supporting one another as we each carry the burden of challenging times and a changing climate. Right now, it’s time to surround Mark and Cass with support and love. Anything you can do that will give him a birthday boost will be appreciated with virtual hugs and/or kisses (by request) from Mark himself.

These are hard times for many and while it’s hard to ask for help,SoulFest’s future depends on it.

SoulFest, an annual 3-day Christian Music Festival focused on Music, Love, & Action, is produced by New Sound Concerts, Inc., a 501c3 started by Dan and Alison Russell in 1978 to bring Christian music to New England. SoulFest’s purpose is to celebrate God’s love and encourage all who attend to live from the inside out as soul-connected, risk-taking Believers in God’s love. The first SoulFest was held in 1998 at Loon Mountain, in Lincoln, NH, and is approaching its 23rd celebration, which will be held at Gunstock Mountain Resort in Gilford, NH (host location since 2004). New Sound Concerts has been producing and promoting Christian concerts in New England for over 40 years and finds itself at a crossroads to carry on.

With little revenue coming in due to the impact of COVID-19,compounding previous debt, our attention is also turned towards the Russell family as they focus on Dan’s recovery from his mid-April stroke and ensuing medical bills.

SoulFest experienced a large financial loss in 2019; we were working hard to implement new ideas and focusing on a fresh lineup to make up for the loss, which was working until COVID-19 hit American soil. When ticket sales slowed, plus vendors and sponsors were being financially impacted and pulling back, closing that gap became more difficult, let alone continuing to pay our small staff. Our paycheck protection loan delayed, forcing layoffs just as SoulFest co-founder, Dan Russell, had a stroke affecting his left (dominant) side. As a singer-songwriter working on his second album, and the creative voice behind SoulFest, this has been incredibly hard on Dan, his family, and the broad community of SoulFest friends beyond the New Sound team.It became apparent that by August in New Hampshire, we would likely not be able to hold an event, even to the size of 2019, forget about increasing attendance. Costs would increase to provide for new social distancing protocols, coupling with low attendance, and put us even further in debt. Postponing became our only option. The live music landscape and gatherings are greatly changed for 2020 and beyond, though we have hope and great anticipation for what they will look like in 2021. This is a highly innovative time in our history. We are pivoting, regrouping, listening, and moving forward.

It’s not all grim, but the legacy and continuation of New SoundConcerts and the SoulFest depend heavily on the support of itspatrons and anyone who cares to continue to see this communityand gathering sustained in New England. This annual event supports the local economy by bringing 8,000-10,000 people to the Laconia area to experience spiritual growth, rejuvenation, and adventure, sending them back inspired to take LOVE into their homes, communities, and around the globe.We need to raise funds to support the New Sound Concerts team in finding a sustainable path forward with the changing landscape for live events and the Russell family through this time of recovery and healing. This $150,000 will provide stability to navigate the new terrain of gathering around SoulFest’s mission, ensuring its platform continues to share the hope and love of God through music.Any amount helps #SaveSoulFest. Exceeding this goal does too.

Thank you for visiting this secret fundraising page! As you know,  Rachel has done—and continues to do—so much for the Ruby community.  So in honor of her birthday this July 9th, and as a gesture of support during these challenging times for the Ruby space and community, I hope you'll consider contributing whatever you can to this fund.

All dollars raised will go directly to helping keep the Ruby doors open--rent is the biggest burden, which is no surprise, and comes to around $13k A MONTH. Speaking of surprises, PLEASE KEEP THIS UNDER YOUR HAT--the plan is to deliver this gift as a surprise to Rachel on her birthday, along with your various messages of love and support.  You can contribute in one or more of the following ways: 1. Donating directly to this GoFundMe page2. Donating the “extra” months of membership back to the Ruby so that you renew at the same time as if your membership had not been paused. (I've already done this, and it came to the equivalent of $400. ) If you would like to do this, please let me know by emailing me or via the CONTACT button below.  Be sure to include 1. the # of months of membership you'd like to donate, and 2. corresponding dollar amount. I will add these #s to the final tally.3. Pass this along to other Rubies!Since Rachel is turning 35, the goal is to raise a minimum of $3,535 (including the cash equivalent for donated membership months) for her birthday.  If we reach that amount, screw the symbolism and let's keep going!Mimi

There will be no spring sports, prom, senior awards banquet, honor convocation or the chance to walk for the last time in the halls of Fraser High School. The opportunity to walk across the stage to receive their long awaited diplomas has sadly also been cancelled. Many of you have been asking what you can do to honor our seniors.  We have decided to use the collected funds from the Senior All Night Party, which they will also miss out on, to give EVERY senior a special gift.  Due to the fact that many of our fund raisers had to be cancelled, we are way short of the money we need to give these kids the special send off they deserve.  We know that nothing can replace the cherished memories they would have made during this time, but we are hoping that this gift will at least give them a lasting memory of their time at Fraser High School and let them know how much as a community we care.  Please know that 100% of all contributions will go directly to our 2020 senior class in the form of various gifts to remember this special time in their lives.

We are still discussing how many people we can safely accommodate. While we obviously would prefer to invite all faculty, along with chief families and significant others, the size of the event will be based on restrictions in place from the Governor. Details will be forthcoming.

There are decades (centuries, really) of activism behind the uprising against racism we are witnessing and participating in on our streets. This combustion of energy is the result of years of hard work by activists who never gave up despite the violent racism at the heart of the American system. Confronting July 4th: Honoring Black and Indigenous Activists is a march and rally to acknowledge and celebrate the organizing of activists. We will march from the east side of Ft. Greene Park in Brooklyn to the 15th Street Entrance in Prospect Park. After the march, we will have a rally with speakers, performers and DJs. Celebrating a new way to think about this “Independence Day”, and our future.July 4th is only days away and we are working hard to make this happen and we need YOUR help.To create this event ethically, we are going to compensate artists and activists who will be on stage, rather than asking them to donate their intellectual, artistic and emotional labor for free. Something that is often expected and rarely rewarded. We will also partner with Black and Indigenous businesses as we produce this event. Here is a list of how your donations will support this event: - Compensation for speakers, performers, artists and DJs- Food, water for people on stage- Art supplies - to make posters for march and stage- March Supplies- bull horns, banner, PPE, sanitizer, wheelchairs- Rally Supplies- A/V equipment, banners, pop up tents, tables/chairs, coolers- Greening and cleaning supplies for the Prospect Park Bandshell- Transport Van * The more you give, the more we will be able to compensate our activists and artists on stage.  When you donate, take action and comment: I stand in Solidarity. OR I stand in Solidarity because (insert thoughts). *""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that there would be no America without stolen land and stolen people. That this fight for life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness didn’t start with the murders of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, and Breonna Taylor, but it began when the first ships invaded these shores. That we can no longer celebrate our country without reckoning with our past and present. That this country is founded on the genocide of indigenous nations, the theft of their land, and the enslavement of African peoples. That the life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness brand that America markets is a dangerous myth as we continue to oppress, dehumanize, and murder. That unless we all commit to fight for the lives and rights of black, brown, indigenous, and other marginalized peoples, we will all continue to suffer the violence of systemic racism and white supremacy. That is why this 4th of July we refuse to celebrate the whitewashing of this country. Instead, we will joyously and actively celebrate and honor the ancestors and activists who have fought and continue to fight tirelessly for the lives and rights of the people."" **The Coalition to Honor Black and Indigenous Activists is a group of mostly LGBTQ activists who have worked together for decades and film professionals who know how to get things done.**"

Uhuru has directed, produced and starred in independent films, including ""Fight in Heels"" and ""Channeling Calafia"". Uhuru has released six full length albums and ten music videos as The Uhuruverse. Uhuru organizes countless shows and events for community and is a frequent speaking artist around the country. Uhuru is also a poor, Black, disabled persxn in Amerikkka. Due to hxstoric systematic racism in the housing system (i.e. redlining & The Homestead Act of 1862), they have been denied access to property and financial well-being their entire life. Uhuru has experiences being unsheltered and on Section 8 housing throughout their life. They've stayed with a variety of family members, lived in motels, vehicles and other vulnerable situations. Uhuru was displaced from their last living situation in Los Angeles and, as their health was simultaneously declining, needed to find an immediate, more affordable place to live. They drove their Black Magic School Bus to New Orleans, where they reside today.   Living with Myasthenia GravisUhuru was diagnosed with Myasthenia Gravis (MG) at the age of 7 (making them a 'one-in-a-million'), a disease that normally effects people over the age of 40. They spent extensive time in intensive care units growing up, on feeding tubes and in hospital beds. Uhuru had multiple surgeries for MG, resulting in recurring long-term healing processes. At times when they were able to leave the hospital, the medical system required them to be on medication and in constant contact with a neurologist.Uhuru lived through their 20s and early 30s with their MG in relapse, self-medicating as needed. The disease has made its way back and Uhuru is currently experiencing a loss of abilities, at a rapid state. Uhuru is currently wheelchaired /paraplegic. In addition, Uhuru is a trans being, whose transition is now on hold, as they now must navigate their MG. The need for hospitalization is imminent.Uhuru's mom is a poor, Black woman, navigating her own struggles, who just moved from Arizona to New Orleans, to take care of Uhuru. Their mom was working two jobs as an essential worker, trying to save money amidst the COVID-19 crisis, putting her own body on the line each day. Her relocation was urgent and she is now recouping the costs of moving across the country. Uhuru's mum is caretaking for Uhuru. They are not receiving aid from The State.Uhuru continuously uses their platform to confront these realities and struggles, on personal and systemic levels. ""Addressing housing for the disabled is a need and a right, not an option"" -Uhuru""Black people are constantly experiencing violence from; being displaced to being violently attacked by white civilians and police with no consequences to follow. A Black life on the street is a life at risk in a fascist state."" - UhuruTHE UHURU DREAM HOUSEUhuru dreams to create  a Safe Art House for Black, queer, trans & intersex beings. Within that space there will be a library, garden, meditation room, sauna/spa, computer room, music studio, film studio, art studio, gym, dance studio, room and board. Uhuru would like to leave the door open to all Black Indigenous beings to come to create or for transitional housing for those who are unsheltered: A SAFE HOUSE.In the midst of being on bed rest last month, Uhuru located housing for themself and negotiated with the owner of the property an agreement to accept a $1,500 intent-to-buy deposit and minimum appraisal amount of $150,000 to purchase the home. From this home they have already BEGUN HOUSING FOLX IN NEED.

This year, on September 9, she would have been 38 years old. Our goal is to earn $100 for every year of her life by holding a 5k/1 mile race in her memory, followed by a splash in the ocean (or lake, river, pool, puddle). Due to COVID-19 this is a virtual race, but looking forward to an in-person race in the future. 

Sometimes when families are dealing with cancer they feel overwhelmed and alone. Last September, Leah, Sam and the boys went on a free week-long trip to Michigan, paid for by The Little Pink Houses of Hope. There they met several other families dealing with the exact same things that they were. It was so comforting to be around people with the same fears, challenges, hopes, and dreams. In Michigan, they found a new family--their “Little Pink Family”. Leah wanted people to donate to Little Pink Houses of Hope in lieu of funeral services when she passed. I know it would make her so happy to know that more families get to enjoy a week away in her memory.

Thank you for considering donating to her cause!"

Loretta Greco has stepped down after 12 wonderful years as Artistic Director for Magic Theatre in San Francisco.   Her last production as AD, Escaped Alone, is playing this November, revamped as a radio play due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  In her tenure as Artistic Director, Loretta was the creative force identifying and developing bold new plays and playwrights. Since Loretta assumed leadership of Magic, the theatre produced 27 world premieres, 21 of which have enjoyed extended life beyond the Magic stage throughout the US and abroad. Magic plays and playwrights have received numerous awards, including the MacArthur Genius Award to Taylor Mac.  And many playwrights whose works have been produced are truly  part of the Magic family, nurtured through the Virgin Play Festival. In addition, many actors and artists behind the scenes have benefitted from Loretta’s eye for talent to become part of the Magic family.Loretta also is the visionary behind Magic’s education and community programming. The Laney College program offers Theatre Arts students an opportunity to attend rehearsals and free performances of Magic’s plays.  “Making Magic” focuses on building literacy and confidence through public speaking, acting and other drama techniques with youth and at-risk adults in the Tenderloin. This is transformative work. As a theatre lover, Loretta has provided me many incredible experiences that I will treasure always.  Along with the Board of Trustees, I hope you will join me in thanking Loretta for her leadership and her creative vision over the past 12 years by contributing to a recognition gift for her.  Your contribution by November 30th would be much appreciated.  Thank you so much for your generosity - it will mean a lot to Loretta.

After 42+ years of dedicated service as an Administrative Professional who helped others with an untiring drive of pure energy that was always presented with a smile and love, our beloved Penny Wolfe is retiring on July 17, 2020.Penny has undoubtedly touched in many unmeasurable ways every man and woman who ever worked for the Fulton County Fire Rescue Department where she started her career soon after it was formed in 1978.  Like me, you may have received the ""phone call"" and heard her voice offering you a job.  Over the years, Penny listened to many of our problems.  Once the issue was in her hands, if at all possible it would be resolved.  Calling Penny and having her call you by your first name was sometimes surprising and always a reassuring moment.  In order to give retirees an opportunity to come together to share a laugh and tell war stories, Penny has organized the Retiree's Breakfast for over fifteen years, to include sending the inivatations, purchasing the food and creating gifts and those coveted ID cards.   And, she has become the Chief Correspondent for all news, celebrating the accomplishments of others and tenderly sharing the moments of sorrow.   Once FCFRD responded to its last call, Penny transitioned to the City of South Fulton Fire Rescue Department and continued to positively impact the careers of many. Her most recent assignment has been with the City of South Fulton HR team.  She was transferred from the fire department because her highly regarded qualities and skills were immediately recognized by the City management team. Hopefully, we all can come together to celebrate Penny with a good ol' fashioned fire station retirement dinner after this COVID-19 event.  For now you can celebrate her and show your love by supporting a dream that she has shared over the years.   That dream is to take a sightseeing road trip with her husband David along the east coast.  Also, Penny enjoys woodworking.  Where does she find the time...?  I am sure she will purchase the latest tool to add to her ever-growing workshop. I hope you will support this fitting gift for a wonderful person and friend who had the utmost respect for firefighters and believed that her job was to make life a little easier for all of us.  In her own words, as written in the FCFRD 25th anniversary yearbook, she stated: My role here has always been in a support capacity, assisting our members in whatever their needs may be.   Now, when I think back to times when I have helped someone, at the end of our conversation when they say ""thank you"" and I say ""my pleasure""...it really has been.  Though Penny never donned bunker gear and fought fire beside you, she was an essential part of the team (family) who was always ready to help.  It is now our time to appropriately welcome her to the D-Shift.   Let's meet or exceed the goal!!!The total amount will be presented to Penny on July 16th or 17th (her last day in the office). Feel free to pass this info to anyone who you think will want to participate. But, LET'S KEEP THIS A SECRET, do not use old mass emails or post to social media because she may be a part of the group. Thank you,

When all was said and done, the new member feedback to the chapter was that the sponsored initiation fees was a difference-maker in the decision to join the house.ALUMNI OPPORTUNITY NUMBER ONE:  This fall, the ACB is getting tight on funds. It is not in a position to cover the $474 per person in new member fees as it did in the spring.  That's where we come in.  Your involvement can really make a difference.  Will you provide the chapter with $474 to cover the costs of a single new member?  We hope to have ten or more new members join us, so we’re looking for at least $4,740 here.Regardless of what other UCLA fraternities are doing, Beta Gamma will rush, and rush aggressively.  The actives need to network and reach out to prospects with a strong message.  The difficulty of the challenge will be compounded because the IFC is not providing fraternities with a list of freshmen men interested in fraternities.   Also, UCLA has drastically reduced the number of students living in the dorms.  With Covid, most rooms at 620 Landfair are for two guys.  At this time, we have 18 actives planning to live in the house for fall.  This leaves 5-8 unused beds in the house that could be offered to new members.  Chapter Advisor Preston Briggs and ACB Chair David Gonzalez believe there are many students who will want to get away from home to live in the UCLA area.  This brings us to . . . ALUMNI OPPORTUNITY NUMBER TWO:  Preston Briggs, David Gonzalez and I would like to see if the alumni could fund one or more new member rooms for the fall quarter only at no cost to the student.  The per person quarterly rent is $2,490.  So, we are looking to gather as many multiples of $2,490 as possible.  Our actives have proven they know how to rush.  Can we count on you for $100, $250, $500 or $1,000 to reward their hard work and get this program rolling?  As with the new member fees, we believe the housing offer will prove very attractive.  In the long run, Beta Gamma will reap the benefits, as it preserves momentum and continues to grow at a time when other houses are losing members.  Thank you, and YITBOS!"

Life is great! Unbeknownst to you, your last gig would be alongside the official DJ of the Miami Heat, DJ Irie and the City of Miami Beach for what would have been a Spring Break concert series for the history books. Then, in what seemed like the blink of an eye, your entire world shuts down. Restaurants and bars close, hotels and night clubs lock their doors. Enter the era of Covid-19. This is the story of Rahsaan ""DJ Fly Guy"" Alexander. Having amassed a 10-year career as the “high energy Rahsaan made a name for himself in the South Florida entertainment industry. With the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, Rahsaan’s career had taken a devastating blow. As we closed out the first month of quarantine, a scary reality began to set in; he may never return to DJ in the beloved clubs and bars on Miami Beach. Depression and anxiety were only two of many different emotions that affected the mental health and stability of Rahsaan.  He knew that he would need to pivot, but challenges presented themselves at every turn and he questioned whether he would be able to continue to provide the soundtrack of the iconic Miami nightlife. In a moment of solitude and deep inflection, Rahsaan made a decision that would ultimately change the course of the remainder of his year. He charged himself with the task of reigniting the zest and enthusiasm he once had for an old love of his, photography. In this same moment another clear and finite decision was made. He would need to take the money he had saved and invest it in redeveloping and refining his once suppressed passion for this creative art form.This pivotal moment quickly went from taking photos for leisure to intentionally capturing moments in time within the city he calls home, Miami. To further his new passion project, Rahsaan has now decided to debut his photojournalist artwork at an exhibition event in December 2020. He is asking for your financial assistance to make this dream come true."

What you might not know is that he has served as ED as a volunteer for many of those years - donating his time, energy, and brilliance to the organization.Throughout his two decades of involvement with RCFL, PK has deeply impacted the Harrison Neighborhood in North Minneapolis, the broader Twin Cities Lutheran Community, and almost everyone who walks through Redeemer’s doors. With his gentle demeanor and fierce passion for justice, PK has touched the hearts and minds of countless program participants, staff members, and supporters. Although he and Cheryl have no biological children of their own, many call them “Mom and Dad” because they make everyone feel a part of the Redeemer Family. PK has cultivated a safe space where everyone belongs and everyone can grow. He transformed so many lives and the community at large as a volunteer ED. Therefore, we are asking for donations to give him an honorarium. No amount of money can equate to the massive impact he’s had, but we would like to honor the Chatman’s with this financial gift, as a small token of our communal gratitude. Please donate before the end of June, as he leaves at the end of this month.Additionally, please email Bex with your thanks, acknowledgements, and whatever else you want PK to know as he departs from RCFL. Bex will compile these notes into a farewell guestbook. Thank you for your generosity! Please contact Bex Klafter with any questions.

She has delivered newspapers every weekend the entire time for about 15 hours a weekend.”  She has also worked at Friendly’s, been a Door Dasher, and probably more - all so that she could pour into the lives of countless boys and girls and young men and women.  Anyone who knows her well also knows how much she serves behind the scenes, often working late at night and on weekends.As a way of honoring all the sacrifices Nancy has made in the last 31 years, would you make a sacrificial donation?  She has given so much to so many for so long!100% of the donations will go directly to her.Would you also post a comment with a favorite memory of Nancy, the first words that come to mind when you think of her, or some other word of encouragement?  Please keep it positive - let’s make this a celebration of her!Please share this post as well.Thanks!

Funeral service for the Neurn family. 

Hey guys as some of you guys may know Theary , Larry, Chantha ,Chann and their mom, their dad/dearly husband passed away yesterday on July 6.2020

This year has honestly been rough as most of you guys know with the pandemic going on. . But aside from that our personal lives he has been in and out of the hospital since March 2020 . With multiple surgeries going on , having to recover ,then going back in again for another procedure, his body was physically exhausted. The hospitals would not let anyone in due to covid 19. Neurn Phon was in there alone trying to recover and staying strong for his family... He went back in again to the emergency room on July 5, then got transferred to intensive care unit on July 6 yesterday morning. The doctors then made their final decision and had called the siblings to inform them that their father/ husband does not have much time left. The siblings and their mother rushed to the hospital where they got to say their good byes to him. Removing a ventilator on him, he then took his last breath and went in peace... 

With a broken heart , I am humbly asking you for your support for the funeral service to lay him Rest In Peace . All donationswill go to their family and for the funeral services. 

thank you

Imagine you are a senior in high school with 3 months to graduation day—you are filled with excitement, anxiety for the unknown, anticipating new adventures, making plans for college, and you cannot wait to walk down the Beasley Coliseum stairs to Pomp and Circumstance and switch over that tassel after you receive your hard-earned diploma. And suddenly, a pandemic hits the nation and changes all of your plans, celebrations, and normal graduation traditions. That is the reality for the PHS Class of 2020.

For these approximately 220 students, there will be no spring sports or final senior games/meets, no theater plays, no senior prom, no senior skip, no senior choir, no graduation party, no signing yearbooks, no graduation parties with extended family and friends, and no official goodbyes to teachers, friends and under-classmates (at least none of these things in the traditional sense). To that end, we are asking all former PHS classes to join together to support the Class of 2020. Here is the plan:1) Our goal is to raise $5,0002) The money will go towards purchasing gift cards from local Pullman businesses (Side Note: let’s help our local economy and community in the process too). The hope is that we can raise enough to provide a $20 gift card to each student.3) These gift cards will be given to students when they pick up their caps and gowns on May 21st. We will include a note with the gift card that mentions all the PHS classes that participate. 4) Deadline for donations—in order to purchase the gift cards and get them to PHS in time, we kindly ask that all donations are made by May 15th. Please indicate your graduation class/year along with your donation in the comments. Please know that all people are welcome to donate to this cause—teachers, community members, etc. Any and all donation amounts will be accepted and appreciated—we know this is a hard time for many, but no donation amount is too small. This effort will take a village. If any community can pull this off, it’s Pullman and the alumni of PHS! Thank you in advance for rallying to support the graduates of 2020!

Special thanks and acknowledgements to Megan Vogt (Symons), Jessica Nazario (Caldwell) and Paula Moore (Faas) for being the braintrust of these creative ideas listed above.

He didn't have all the riches of the world, but he had heart. He moved genuinely. If you were around Daniel anything he had you had. If you needed anything that he had to spare it was yours.

Rebecca, of course, replied with a resounding and incredibly on-brand, “BET,” and thus the scheming began. Days later, Rebecca rolled up to Jasmine’s backyard with a bullhorn, a protest sign and a simple message: “Black Love Matters,” formally asking for Jasmine’s hand in booship. How we met:The first time was in 2016 at a Juvenile Justice seminar in the Richmond Public Library’s Main Branch. We know what you’re thinking, we locked eyes from across the room, mouths agape, music swelling, turtle doves materializing from thin air; but the truth is that Jasmine actually first witnessed the beauty of Rebecca…..…’s shoes. These oil slick shoes first gifted to them were now a gift unto the world! Working the table in the back while simultaneously working the hell out of these dark, rouge-tinted statement makers, we bonded over the moment, enjoying each other’s style and energy in a moment that felt like we’d been friends before.  Newly in love (again, with the shoes) legend has it was here that Jasmine confirmed that if Rebecca was walking through the world like this, she’d be down to walk side by side wherever they’re going.Our friendship grew and deepened after May of 2018 when we were called to respond to a catalytic event in our lives and Richmond: the police murder of 26-year-old, black educator Marcus-David Peters. Peters, who was experiencing a mental health crisis was met with lethal force at the hands of Richmond law enforcement when he needed help.We spent hours around a wooden table in the basement of Second Baptist Church West End, with our comrades, faith leaders and a grieving yet resilient family. There, we decided to make it impossible for this city to forget the name Marcus-David Peters.That work has led to countless marches, town halls, teach-ins, art builds, op-eds, and hundreds of people being politicized all for the Justice and Reformation movement. Our lives were bound to this duty then, and we continue to commit our lives to that mission now, a commitment we made together. Juneteenth engagement: At midnight on Juneteenth, the day Black people celebrate our emancipation from slavery, we made the choice to commit our lives to one another through marriage. It felt so surreal, and so right. Our time organizing together has continued to lead us to a place of deep trust, healthy communication, and creative problem solving; the cornerstones of any meaningful relationship. We know that we are our ancestor’s wildest dreams, and we are making a commitment to make them proud with our union, loving and nourishing one another through marriage.  The ask:For our wedding, we have made the decision to raise funds to afford it. We’ve witnessed firsthand what little miracles can happen when a community comes together and we are asking for your help in making this possible. The funds that you contribute will go to sufficiently compensating our talented comrades and friends who are our florists, musicians, officiants, cooks, photographers, and artists of varying media. Our friends and comrades have answered the calls to action for justice by donating their time, talent, and energy to the movement. Your donation will also cover the cost of materials needed to pull off our country queer farm wedding and keep our guests safe during  COVID-19. We expect that some friends and comrades may refuse compensation, in which case we will donate their payment to an organization or individual of their choosing and find a creative way to thank them directly.  If we exceed our goal, those funds will be split between Southerner’s On New Ground and our nest egg fund which is being organized by our queer fam. We want this day to be shared, redistributing funds to our people and celebrating our love the best way we know how to. Together.  Black love is essential.

Covid-19 of 2020 caused my siblings to become deathly ill and some hospitalized for a significant length of time; thereby causing our family farm Circle “R” to horrifically suffer of non -operation.  Also in our area the Cattle Stock yards and Meat Processing Centers were closed not allowing us to sell our livestock to maintain the farm. Therefore we had no resources to hire farm help to assist with maintaining the farm while my brothers were ill with Corona Virus.  Additionally, monetary resources were loss from our crops production of not being able to be sold to local stores. To date, stores were not accepting locally grown crops not certified through USDA standards due Covid-19. Literally no resources are flowing our way to sustain his farm operation. Our goal is to raise $500k to retain the ownership and operation of our inherited family farm. Mr. Roberts is a 3rd Generation Farmer that operates and maintains the original 40 acres of land provided by the Land Allotment Act of Emancipation Proclamation.    Mr. Roberts is trying to sustain his generational handed down land while simultaneously assisting his community to live healthier lives. This is done by providing his community with locally grown raised and harvested foods.  This the best and cheapest way to go, since they are not factory farms that rely on artificial growth hormones and unnatural living conditions for the animals in order to maximize profits.  As a local farmer he’s able to provide direct information when asked about his livestock, what they are fed, and their prices in order to determine what will best fit your family’s needs and budget.

Your Gift Doubled!Through the generosity of a partner, AIM AIR has been blessed with A Matching Gift to assist us in our “Beyond 45” giving campaign. Each dollar invested in AIM AIR prior to October 31st will be matched up to $50,000. Please consider partnering with us through this significant Matching Gift.Friends, this year COVID-19 took a toll on AIM AIR. Our normal flight schedule dropped to half of our budgeted amount, resulting in losses of about $25,000 per month. Despite financial reserves that initially offset our monthly losses, we are projecting a $100,000 shortfall in our Operations Fund by the end of the year.Established 45 years ago in 1975, AIM AIR has been using aviation in East and Central Africa to help missionaries and the local church go beyond the end of the road. Many Africa Inland Mission (AIM) missionaries serve in extremely isolated, remote, and often insecure areas among people that have little exposure to, or understanding of, the Good News. Using aircraft has allowed us to keep missionary communities connected to the rest of the world.When we look “Beyond 45” years of ministry we believe God will continue to have a purpose for AIM AIR. There is still a need for safe and reliable aviation support within AIM and the church in East and Central Africa. We have the tools and desire to offer our support as a lifeline to those living in remote and isolated areas for years to come.We need your help. The “Beyond 45"" campaign will ensure the survival of AIM AIR. As the 2020 shortfall is met we are eager to begin reducing our flight costs to AIM missionaries – now more isolated than ever because of COVID travel restrictions. Funds will then transition to covering some of the fixed costs of AIM AIR, significantly lowering the cost of our flights into the future.While Beyond 45 is primarily about outlasting this pandemic, we hope you also see it as the beginning of a new opportunity to better support missionaries and the church in East and Central Africa. Let’s go Beyond 45 together and see what God has planned.Will you go Beyond 45 with us and be a lifeline?All funds given to AIM through this GoFundMe campaign will go towards the AIM AIR Operations fund - a project of Africa Inland Mission. Interested in giving by check or other means or becoming a monthly investor?

Drew Sheard Ministry Relief Fund was established in response to the growing need for support by ministries affected by Covid-19. With limited resources and the inability to physically gather, churches, pastors, itinerate ministers and musicians around the world have found themselves in an absolute state of emergency. This ecumenical effort will raise as much as we can and assist as many as we can. While we are fully aware that we may not be able to award every applicant, our transparent process will prove that we attempted to award as many as possible. Some ministries are thriving and doing well, but so many more are hurting and facing foreclosure. This deadly virus has taken so many Pastors from us, leaving churches around the country without leadership. They need our help and together we can make a difference!

We understand that this is a tough time for many, but we have faith that God will see us through this season as He has always - we serve a faithful God!As you may have heard, it has been difficult to pay off the monthly funds for JWTV, the ministry's television channel; the rent/keep of 265 church branches; as well as the salaries of thousands of employees in varying offices around the nation.By the grace of God, all three years of the ministry have been extremely fruitful with the harvesting of hundreds of thousands of souls, thousands have been healed, and even more delivered from their burdens. As many of you have been strengthened in your faith by the revelatory teachings, words of wisdom, and Godly counsel that the Apostle has shared in his time serving the Lord, we ask that you would sow a seed of faith during this time to help pay off the current statements and to keep the efforts alive of everyone who has ever contributed up until this point. As always, you are in our prayers and we thank you for standing with us during this crucial time!We ask that you give whatever amount you can, and even more so that you would pray for the thousands being affected at this time.

This gear is used exclusively by our entire Troop, Crew as well as our Cub Scouts. The Troop does have insurance on the trailer. Unfortunately, it comes with a very high deductible and a max payout for the policy. Once both of these factors are taken into consideration we will only receive 25-30% of the replacement cost of the trailer and all of its contents. We are heading into summer camp season with no gear and are hoping you can help.Troop 914 was established in 1996 with six Scouts, two tents, and one piece of outdoor cooking equipment. Over those years, our young men worked hard and acquired sleeping bags, cooking equipment, tents and a trailer to haul and house this equipment.In the last 24 years, Troop 914 has created over 60 Eagle Scouts and 10 Eagle Scouts Palms. Our Troop and the overall mission of the Boy Scouts of America is to prepare young men to make ethical choices over their lifetimes by instilling in them the values of the scout oath and law. Scouting is a Leadership program, our young scouts have fun camping, working with the community and studying science, medicine, engineering, politics, journalism, business, finance and project management.Our Troop does not have enough funds to replace the equipment without passing this burden onto our young men and their families.

We are chosen for this historic task.We are indeed lucky to be chosen for this monumental task!""and build the house; and I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, saith the LORD."" Haggai 1:8We are in the process of securing a loan and facilitating a down payment on a church building we are planning to purchase by the grace of God. The bank we are working with to secure the loan from has set some preconditions for us to maintain a specified cash flow balance. As a church that relies on the generous donations of its congregation we have to turn to the children of God and request the faithful to generously donate whatever they can as soon as possible.Because the COVID-19 restrictions we have not been able to assemble in church and as a result, donations to our church have been at a very low point for the past several months. The Head of our church, our Father and members of the Parish Council are working hard day and night to successfully finalize the purchase of this church building as soon as possible.Let's remind ourselves that we are where we are today by the grace of God and although what we mere mortals give is not sufficient to the glory of God; we need to do what we can and partake of the blessings of Almighty God.Our bank has advised us to maintain a minimum balance of $150,000, please let's come together and meet this minimum requirement!The bible tells us King David who was favored by God while he was still a shepherd boy, and about who God testified ""I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after mine own heart, which shall fulfil all my will."" (Acts 13:22). Although David had a strong desire to build the Temple of God, he was not permitted to do so. The chance was given to his son Solomon. We are chosen like Solomon!Let's remind ourselves the prayer of David (Ps 132:1-5)1 Lord, remember David, and all his afflictions:2 How he sware unto the Lord, and vowed unto the mighty God of Jacob;3 Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go up into my bed;4 I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine eyelids,5 Until I find out a place for the Lord, an habitation for the mighty God of Jacob.Let's rise up in the spirit of David and purchase our church building!!!By the grace of God, the prayer and beseeching of our Father the Head of our church, the prayer and support of the faithful children of God let's purchase our church building to have a lasting place for the Ark of The Covenant and a place of prayers and refuge for the faithful.The building is to be purchased in the name of our church, for the use of our church and for the benefit of the faithful children of God. Let's rejoice and give with joy for we have received the bounties of God May the peace of God be upon us allDebre Menkirat Kidus Amanuel & Rufael Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahdo Church"

Help Save the MAS Iowa Masjid and Community Center from Foreclosur.
This is an urgent message to the American Muslim community to save a local masjid building and a MAS community Center in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. The masjid is in an urgent need for a $30,000 to be paid before october in order to save the building from going for foreclosure.  The masjid building was purchased back in 2010 for the price of $1 million. Throughout the last nine years about $700,000 have been paid. 
Quick Facts: 

The MAS Center in Iowa serves 200 refugee families monthly through free groceries, furniture donations and access to vital resources.

The center helped set up more than a dozen businesses run by refugees from Somalia and Iraq.

150 local-income families and senior citizens receive free groceries weekly through the center.

100+ community members pray Jumuah at the center every week where the five daily prayers are also conducted.

The center offers Quran and Tajweed classes, Judo and Karate classes, matrimonial services, community events and more.

A full gymnasium offers Muslim youth numerous opportunities for recreational activities.

The MAS Iowa Center has never faced foreclosure before and is diligent in making its payments.

With your contributions, we hope to continue the legacy of supporting our community for many years to come! 
MAS Iowa Center's Current Payment Arrangement:
The total remaining payoff amount on the masjid after completing this $30,000 payment is $290,000, which is scheduled to be paid at a rate of $95,000/year for the next three years. Payments are structured as following: $3,200/month, which we have never failed to pay and $58,000 once in May of each year, which we had difficulty in paying this year because of the pandemic. MAS Iowa was able to make a $28,000 payment and asks for your help in collecting $30,000 to pay the remaining in order to stave off foreclosure.
 
All your donations to MAS Iowa are tax deductible.
MAS Tax ID#:36-3885457
Please help us again to save the building and the masjid and remember, that Allah builds a palace for you in Jannah if you contribute to His masjid. More importantly, we pray Allah grants you permission to be in His neighborhood and calls you “My neighbor,""  as described in the authentic hadeeth. May Allah bless you, strengthen your efforts of support, maximize your rewards, and grant you a palace in Jannah. Ameen!

The administration required the dismissed professors to sign a “Separation Agreement and Release” in order to receive severance pay. Included in this “Agreement” are requirements not to disclose any of its content, including even the acknowledgment of the Agreement’s existence. In fact, anyone who signs this document pledges himself not to talk about it, with anyone except his lawyer or accountant. Not even his pastor.Not even his wife. This document also requires those who sign it to promise never to “make any public or private statements (whether oral or in writing) that are derogatory or damaging to Southern Seminary, or any of its administration, faculty or staff, except as required in response to a subpoena, court order, or other legal compulsion….” Two professors are unwilling to sign this document, which means that the seminary will not provide them with any severance pay.  For 22 years Dr. Russell Fuller was a full professor of Old Testament, Hebrew & Aramaic at Southern. For 18 years Dr. Jim Orrick was a full professor of literature and culture at Boyce College. Both men served with distinction.  They deserve to be provided with a proper severance. Since the seminary they have served for decades refuses to provide this unless they sign the NDA, I have taken it upon myself to raise money to help replace what is being withheld from them.  To do this, we need to raise $40,000. So I am asking you to consider contributing to this need to help these faithful men who are standing on principle. All monies received will go to make up for the money being withheld from them by Southern Seminary.

Hey friends,

Yes, we know, it's a weird time right now for a lot of things, especially starting a new church (and raising money for it). But we are just crazy enough to believe Jesus when He says stuff like ""You are my hands and feet"" and ""Go love your neighbor and help people follow me."" And because of that, we have this undeniable confidence that this moment, this wild moment we are living through, is just the right time to move forward with the hope of the Gospel by planting a church!

And that's why we're here, asking you to partner with us!

WHEN WILL WE START:Our plans are to launch our first Online Service September 13th with open Home Churches launching later in the Fall (as safety permits).

WHO ARE WE:We are a diverse group of 18 adults that are being sent out and supported by The Movement Church in East Oakland (led by Pastor Edward Paz). We've spent the last 12-15 months together gathering to pray, dream, plan, study and serve - all for the goal of starting a new church that would be able to reach and love the people around us! And here we are, in what seems like a new world, but with the same clear call - to love God, love our neighbors and help people follow Jesus.



 WHAT WILL WE DO:

Great question. We haven't found a manual on how to start a new church in the midst of a Global Pandemic (let us know if you stumble upon one). Because there are a lot of unknowns in this season, we are sticking close to the basics. 1. Teach through the Bible in an engaging online weekly service.2. Launch Home Churches where everyone can use their gifts to flourish.3. Engage Skeptics by creating safe spaces to explore faith (Alpha ).WHAT'S THE MONEY FOR:



 

We are GRATEFUL for your partnership & prayer and look forward to sharing the stories to come!- Christopher & The Movement Life TeamStay Updated:Website  / Facebook  / Instagram

I desire to be fully His and undivided. I desire to proclaim with my whole life the freedom in Christ which is offered to all and which heals all.The obstacle: $103,000 in student loansThe story: Raised Catholic in a loving family, my eyes were opened to a greater depth of love in my freshman year at Oregon State University when I first encountered the Saint John Society and Society of Mary, missionary religious orders originally from Argentina. During my four years at OSU, I continued to seek a deeper faith in Christ through prayer and service while studying for my undergraduate degree. Since I was little, I have felt the need to try to alleviate the suffering of those around me.  As a I grew older, this need allowed me to see my future as a nurse. After my four years at OSU, I moved to Portland, Oregon to pursue this dream and I graduated with my BSN in August of 2018. After working as an RN for some time, I began to experience a need for something more. I would come home from my shifts, pray, and experience the most subtle sadness.  This sadness confused me because my job was even better than I thought it would be. I loved nursing even more than I thought I would, and even with that, I felt a small sadness. Fast forward some months, I took a trip to walk the Camino de Santiago and to visit Fatima and Rome. I felt a new freedom to abandon my will and repose it in the will of my Father. With this freedom, I opened my heart to listen to the Lord in regards to my vocation. Up until this point, I had always believed I had found my vocation: to be a wife, mother, and nurse. Slowly, the Lord began to change these desires and opened my eyes to the way of life that most makes me alive and utilizes my talents. I began to discern the religious life with the Society of Mary - the group of sisters who evangelized me at 18. Since I began my discernment, I have experienced fulfillment as I had never experienced before. I have more joy, excitement, and love as I look at my life through the vision of this vocation. It is as if every aspect of my life, all the joy and suffering, makes sense in light of this call. This desire, to give of myself completely, totally, fully, and undivided to Jesus Christ and to my brothers and sisters in Him, has always been the root desire in me. As I move forward and answer the Lord with a ""yes"" to the call to be consecrated to Him, I see that the Lord also calls me to retain the most fundamental aspects of nursing and to bring them with me into this new life. As a sister in the Society of Mary, my joy will be to proclaim the healing medicine of Christ, freedom in Him, and Him as the true source of abundant life and hope. How you can help: First and foremost, I humbly ask for your prayers. I have entrusted this obstacle to the intercession of St. Joseph, and with joy, I accept the will of the Father for me. Second, if you feel called and can support me financially, I am heartily grateful. Please feel free to contact me with any questions you have, or if you would like to hear more about my story!"

Let's get this family to Canada!As you may know, the media has done very little to report on the ongoing conflict in Iraq, which has resulted in more than 3 million people fleeing for their lives. Many of these are wonderful, safe, friendly people who are taking refuge in Jordan as they seek asylum in a safe country. And sadly, America is accepting only a tiny number refugees for resettlement.Many of us are terribly frustrated about this situation, and are forced to look for other alternatives to help our displaced friends. That's why I am asking for you to join me to help a dear Iraqi refugee family start a new life in Canada!Thankfully, Canada still allows private sponsorship for resettlement of refugee families.  The family that this GoFundMe campaign will help has been accepted for sponsorship by a church in Ottawa. The church needs the first year expenses for this family to be raised before the Canadian government will allow them to emigrate. That amount for this family of four is $40,000 (US dollars), we already have $10,000 fundraised. 100% of the money raised will go to this sponsorship, allowing them to leave Jordan and start a new life in Canada. North Pointe Baptist Church is accepting all donations for this family.This amazing family (father, mother, 9-year-old son and 5-year-old daughter) fled from Iraq because of the unspeakable violence and religious persecution they endured. They are currently in Jordan, where they have been waiting for more than three years for a country to accept them. They cannot stay in Jordan. Laws prohibit them from working and their kids are not able to go to public school. There is no future for them here, and they cannot safely return to Iraq.I am unable to put their names or photo on this page for security reasons. They still have family in Iraq and they fear retaliation against them. When they are safely in Canada you will receive a full report with their story of life in Iraq along with photos and an update on their trip to freedom.Please help this family begin a new life. Any donation will help, but please be as generous as possible! Our goal is big, but I know your heart is even bigger!

On Tuesday, October 27th around 6:40 pm, an unexpected fire started on the roof of The New Life Baptist Church Of Philadelphia . The fire travelled downward, burning through the entire attic (where the children’s room was) to the rest of the back side of the building. Some items were salvageable, but everything else was destroyed. Thankfully, no one was injured and the fire department was quick to the scene. Amidst the pandemic, we have been holding our services on Facebook Live and Zoom while the praise team and pastor were physically at church. However, due to the circumstances, we will have to temporarily hold all of our services and events on Zoom or in another facility. The money that is raised through this GoFundMe will be used to reconstruct the stage, the pastor’s office and the children’s room. It will also be used to replace any destroyed items such as hymn notes, Bibles, microphones, modems, etc. New Life Baptist Church of Philadelphia has been a place where countless memories were made with both members of the church and friends in the community. Although we are saddened that this has happened, we are grateful that many has stepped up to offer their hands of service however they can, ready to rebuild the church! Please pray for us as we begin our road to reconstruction! Any amount is appreciated. If you can, please share this to your friends and family in whatever method you can. We truly thank you for your support.

I dedicated over twenty years of my life to serving the Church, and those who have known me supported this call. I began my studies for priesthood in the Archdiocese of New York, and Cardinal Dolan nominated me to continue my studies at the Pontifical North American College (NAC) in Rome. There I met with continued achievement as a top-student with accolades from the Cardinal, faculty, and peers.While at the NAC, I witnessed inappropriate physical behavior committed by the vice-rector, Father Adam Park, toward a seminarian. The seminarian later divulged to me that Father Park made other physical contact described as “hurtful.” My concern for my classmates’ safety was only heightened as I received additional reports alleging inappropriate behaviors by the vice-rector, urging for an investigation into these behaviors, and even citing an instance of a seminarian “crying out for help.”In October of 2018, I was told by physicians that I needed to return to New York for urgent surgery. I obtained permissions for a brief six-week leave which Cardinal Dolan approved in writing, and I continued all of my studies during my recovery. Five days before I was to return to the NAC, the Cardinal informed me that the NAC rector, Father Peter Harman, was blocking my return on the basis of fabricated claims against my “permission documentation” and formation easily disprovable by evidence. I requested on five occasions a meeting with the Cardinal which he denied me. It became apparent that he wanted neither to allow me to present my documentation refuting the false statements against me, nor to receive evidence of Father Park’s alleged misconduct. In good faith, I could not be complicit with what I believed was a cover-up of what I knew of the vice-rector, and I could do no other than resign under duress as a seminarian. Were it not for Cardinal Dolan’s handwritten food-stained letter sealing his refusal to grant me an impartial interview, I would have been ordained a deacon this year and soon after a priest.Unfortunately, I am only one of hundreds of seminarians documented to have been retaliated against over the past twenty years for exposing clerical misconduct taking place in seminaries. This situation has led to a dramatic decrease in priestly ordinations which in just one year recently declined by 27 percent.Amid pleas for help by NAC seminarians, many supporters and I reported my case to every level of the Church hierarchy for over a year-and-a-half imploring that I be given a chance to present my evidence, clear my name, and have an investigation opened into Father Park’s alleged misconduct. While Fathers Harman and Park to this day remain in their roles exerting control over vulnerable NAC seminarians, my reports have gone unaddressed, depriving me of justice from a Church I so faithfully served. The apparent cover-up taking place validates what many have told me: culpable Church leaders will listen to my case only when faced with a lawsuit. Having exhausted all options to resolve my case in the Church, I now prepare to take legal action. Professionals are confident I have a strong case given the copious evidence I possess. As my lawyer prepares to file suit, I realize that those to be held accountable have massive financial resources only bolstered by their many appeals for donations. For this reason, I ask your support that will allow my legal case to move forward and uphold my efforts to raise awareness so that no seminarian should have to suffer as I have. My case is not the first involving the victimization of seminarians, but with your help, I hope that it may be the last.I also invite you to learn more and stay updated about this case by following and sharing the blog “Save our Seminarians"": saveourseminarians.wordpress.com May good men and women take this chance to stand up for what is right, so that silence may no longer yield new generations of victims. Thank you."

I am writing to you with the hope that you might be able to help. There is currently an undergoing project of a church being built in a city near Nebelet, Ethiopia. It’s in a very rural area out in the countryside. The project has been delayed countless times due to a few reasons. The first being, people in this area live in extreme poverty and do not have the means to donate money to the church. The second being, there is equipment and materials that are needed to build a well-built church with a strong base foundation. There has been no support from outside sources to help complete this. When I heard about this, I knew I had to figure out a way to be a service to others. Since this is a big project, I know that it will take a team of people to bring it to life. As Orthodox, we understand the importance of a church and being able to have a place of worship. With all of your donations, the church will be built without any delays. There will be updates on the progress of this church through videos and photos to show you how your contribution is making a difference.  Thank you all in advance! “And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock, I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it” - Matthew 16:18In Christ,Brhan Woldu"

For the past two summers, I had the joy to be their summer intern. What a wonderful time and I was able to encounter these sweet Sisters!I visited the Motherhouse  in June. Don’t worry we kept our social distance ;)

I didn't come here specifically to provide a Air Ambulance service, but upon arriving here we quickly saw the daily, needless loss of life on many of the remote islands around us all because of a lack of transportation. The boats that are available can cost the patient's family up to 50,000p ($1000) to hire, but they are slow and when the waves get big they have to let the patient suffer and die in the clinic since the boats can't go.     Now PAMAS has one helicopter and two airplanes on the island of Palawan making hundreds of medevac flights each year. Our services are free to the indigent and all others just pay for our fuel if they can. I absolutely love this work! The people here deserve this service and we are happy to provide it for them!    At the heart of our small fleet of aircraft is a Cessna U206F. Despite having only one engine it is the perfect air ambulance for us. In May of 2017 we overhauled the engine and since then it has flown almost 300 medevac flights! The shortest of these flights is 2 hrs, but many of these flights are from 4-7 hrs.    This brings me to the heart of my appeal for help. This engine is about to time out and EVERY TIME this has happened our aircraft go out of service for at least SIX months! We have to wait for parts to be shipped to and from the States and as a pilot I dread this because we have no other aircraft that can continue serving the people and this means going back to the uncalled for loss of life.   Are you willing to partner together with us in order to keep these life saving, air ambulance services accessible to the people of this region of the Philippines? Would you please join us as volunteer pilots and medical staff here who are constantly risking our lives to show these people that in God's eyes they are highly valued? If so please help us reach our goal of at least $38,000.    This money will used to purchase a complete engine, ship it to the Philippines and probably be enough to overhaul our existing propeller. From the one who see's these patients almost every day and who constantly hears their health care providers telling us of how much they praise God for our services, I want to say THANK YOU very much for your help!

Please accept our humble obeisances.  All glories to Srila Prabhupada!  All glories to Guru and Gauranga!
 
2020 is a milestone year in so many ways.  It would have been Srila Bhakti Tirtha Swami’s 70th birthday and this month of June marks the 15th Anniversary of His Holiness’ disappearance. As an offering to Bhakti Tirtha Swami to commemorate these auspicious occasions we would like to humbly invite you to join a global initiative to raise funds to clear the mortgage balance on Gurudeva’s Gita Nagari Institute House and preserve His Holiness’ legacy for future generations.

This house is where Gurudeva wrote many of his books, performed his transcendental final pastimes and departed this world. As per his wishes, this is where Maharaja’s personal items and paraphernalia are maintained and displayed, where we host sannyasis and senior Prabhupada disciples, continue to have devotional activities and where the stewards Vrajalila & Ekavira reside. Krsna has given us this wonderful opportunity to come together as an international family to finally secure this building.

We’ve had many challenges with the property over the years, and we are now facing one of the most urgent.  Two years ago we were successful in getting the title deed transferred to the Institute, but we did not refinance so the existing mortgage is not in IFAST’s name. The lender has now decided to call the loan, which requires us to either refinance, pay off the balance or risk foreclosure. After considering all the options and seeking guidance from Bhakti Tirtha Swami’s close Godbrothers, we have realized that this is a wonderful opportunity to pull together as the family and community that Bhakti Tirtha Swami saw us to be, and show our love and appreciation for the amazing personality who touched, and still touches, all our lives.  
 
We know it’s a difficult economic time for so many, but we feel encouraged and enthusiastic at this chance to let Krishna work his magic through all of us on behalf of his dedicated servant.  
 
The payoff amount is $87,000, and our deadline is June 27th 2020 to commemorate Gurudeva’s departure date.  By Guru’s and Krishna’s mercy, several devotees have already pledged $45,000.   If all of us give what we can  - no amount is too small and every offering is meaningful – we know that we can reach the goal and secure this property for once and for all.  
 
We are all blessed by the best! Please make your contribution to our joint offering by clicking on the GoFundMe link, and feel free to spread the word.  Remember, no amount is too small to honor Maharaja’s life, preaching and commitment in service of Srila Prabhupada’s vision.

Your servants with gratitude

On Sunday, August 23rd, my beloved brother, Jared, was tragically killed in a workplace accident. Receiving the news that Jared was gone, was devasting and heartbreaking for our entire family, especially Nikita and the boys.  Jared was a hard working family man. He lived for Nikita, Connor and Abel; nothing came before them. He was a devoted husband and father, always making every day fun and special for them. Jared enjoyed his job, but more importantly he loved his co-workers and they loved and appreciated him too. Jared will be remembered for his contagious smile and laugh. He was a generous, kind, respectful young man.We are asking for donations to help contribute towards Connor and Abel’s postsecondary education and provide allowance for other family expenses. All proceeds will go directly to Nikita, Connor and Abel. Any amount is greatly appreciated as they continue the mourning and grieving process due to the loss of Jared.On behalf of Nikita, Connor and Abel, their closest friends and the entire family, I appreciate the outpouring of love, prayers, and support shown over the past couple of weeks and undoubtedly, in the months and years to come.The Aleris/Novelis family will match the first $100,000.00  donated.

In addition to losing a loving husband and devoted father, Megan and the kids have also lost significant financial resources. Unfortunately, although Pete had limited life insurance, it is woefully insufficient to provide Elsie, Cora, and Christopher the rich childhood, overflowing with sports, arts, music, and adventure, that Megan and Pete always intended.To that end, we are seeking donations to help Megan defray existing and increased childcare costs that she will now have to bear without Pete.  Everyone who crossed paths with Pete, whether in Cheshire, at Yale or Michigan, or in San Diego, knows that he was an absolutely remarkable man.  Michigan Law School grad.  Captain of the 2000 Yale Football Team.  First Assistant U.S. Attorney in San Diego.  Partner at Jones Day. More importantly, he was a caring son and brother, a loving husband, and a devoted father.  In addition to all that, he was the most faithful of friends.  Pete's obituary, which can be found here , is a beautiful tribute that more fully describes Pete's amazing life.  And Megan has established an email account, [email redacted], so that we can all share stories, notes, photos, and more with Elsie, Cora, and Christopher about their incredible dad now and over the years.Throughout the years, Pete, Megan, and their family have stood shoulder-to-shoulder with so many of us – their family, friends, teammates, and colleagues - through times good and bad.  Now, in these most trying times, we have the chance to provide Pete’s family with that same support and to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Megan and their kids now and in the coming days.Thank you all so very much in advance as we come together to help Megan and her family during this unimaginable time.   Friends of Pete

Tracy fought a courageous battle over the past four months and passed away peacefully this morning.  Tracy’s four children Kimberly (23), Patrick (20), KellyAnn (18) & James (11) have been continuously at her side. To know Tracy was to love her and she was loved by so many.  She was a wonderful wife, mother, daughter, sister & friend.  She had the biggest heart and was always the first to lend a helping hand, be a listening ear, or shoulder to cry on.  She touched so many lives with her kindness, huge generosity, and caring spirit.  She found such pleasure in being surrounded by those she loved and having everyone gather together at her home.  Tracy's greatest passion & accomplishment in life was being a mom.  She loved her children more than anything and would do anything for them.  Having suffered such hardship when they lost their father, she always wanted to protect them and would do everything she could to fill their lives with happiness & joy.  There was never a game, social event or school gathering that she did participate in (and often organized) and could always be heard cheering the loudest, telling a story or laughing with everyone.  With her incredible support system in her family, friends, neighbors and colleagues, she now needs our help to ease any burden off her children as they mourn their mother.  They will need us more than ever now.  It is truly impossible to express how much she meant to all of us and how profoundly she will be missed. Please help us to keep her memory eternal.  A GoFundMe campaign has been set up to support the educational costs for Tracy’s children along with financial support. She now joins her love Jimmy, with whom she had an intensely special and strong connection.  They had a type of love that we all hope to experience in our lives.

Lucas is fighting for his life and needs your help.Lucas is a six-year-old CANCER WARRIOR who lives in Austin, Texas with his parents, big brother Jack (9), and little sister Dylan (4 and a future hero). He is a sports fanatic and a die-hard Boston sports fan (thanks to his mom Erin). He can be found cheering on the Red Sox and Celtics any chance he can as well as his parents’ alumni, the Texas Longhorns.On July 31st, 2020, Lucas was diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). AML is a RARE cancer, affecting less that 500 children per year in the United States. Lucas immediately underwent a first round of chemotherapy that was unsuccessful in eradicating the cancer cells from his bones. At the end of 28 days of chemo, 60% cancer still remained. Round two called for a more aggressive and intense plan. It involved targeted FLT3 drugs and adult level chemotherapy that have only been used in trials with some children. They are currently evaluating the effect of this treatment and we are keeping our fingers crossed.With AML the white blood cells produced in Lucas's bone marrow are abnormal and do not become healthy cells. These abnormal cells are unable to fight off infection and can be life threatening. Not only is AML exceptionally rare in children, but the mutations of Lucas's cancer are even more rare and unique (FLT3 Non-ITD N676K - less than 20 adolescent cases per year). All pediatric cancers are considered rare and therefore underfunded, under researched, and information about these cases isn't widely shared nor publicized, even within the medical community.Inevitably, Lucas will need a Bone Marrow Transplant. The good news is we have already found a perfect match in his sister Dylan (hence the hero title above), but we need to get Lucas into remission first. We must find a treatment plan that targets Lucas’s exact mutation and eradicates the cancer in his bones. To learn more about Lucas’s specific cancer type and share any pertinent information that might help connect them with other families, please visit this page:  https://www.lucasbear.org/beat-aml.The Gourley family decided to relocate to Houston so that Lucas can receive the best care and treatment at MD Anderson Cancer Center. Erin and Brian are solely focused on saving Lucas’s life and being present for Jack and Dylan. They are switching roles every 72 hours at the hospital entrance and only allowed to be with each other for about 15 minutes because Lucas is at constant risk of spiking a fever or other things escalating due to the nature of AML. Their ability to earn income has been severely impacted and the expenses are mounting. Insurance is only covering partial costs of some of Lucas's treatment, as well as the clinical trials and drugs that are in their future. They are doing all of this amidst a pandemic and have limited help due to quarantining restrictions and fear of infection.Lucas is a brave warrior but has a long road ahead of him. This fight will be exhausting on all fronts, but we will do whatever it takes to save Lucas and get him the care he needs. It can take years to recover from the financial devastation that childhood cancer treatment can have on a family. We have started this GoFundMe page as a way to ease some of the financial burden the Gourley family is facing and take a bit of the worry off their plates. We understand that this year has been hard on many people, so if you cannot support financially, please continue to pray for Lucas and his family. Erin and Brian are eternally grateful for all the love and support they have already received, even from people they don’t know. Thank you in advance and please reach out to one of us if you have any questions or other ways to help. With much gratitude and hope, Betsy Flanagan & Kathy Sutherland(friends and prayer warriors)

As many of you know, Pete Higgins passed away on the morning of June 3rd, 2020. Pete was a loving husband to his partner Becky, a devoted father to his children Catie, Jane, Quinn, and Mickey, and a star faculty member at Princeton Day School. Today we are reaching out to the PDS community, to those who care for Pete’s loved ones, and to anybody whose life has been impacted by Pete, to give back to his family. Catie is a student entering her senior year at Oberlin College. Mickey (‘23) and Jane (‘22) are in high school at PDS, and Quinn (‘23) attends the Newgrange School, where Becky also works.  All funds will be used for funeral expenses, medical bills, to ensure that Mickey and Jane can remain at PDS, and, additionally, to finance the continuing education of Pete’s children. Given the financial strain that the COVID-19 pandemic has put on the economy and the fact that Becky Higgins will now be the sole provider for her four children, any donations would be much appreciated and immediately used for the aforementioned necessities. We are asking out of love. We are in the midst of a pandemic, our country is coming to terms with racial injustice, and the future is unknown. To move forward in any endeavor, we must act with loving compassion. We know that everyone is going through hardship, trauma, loss, and grief during this time. We understand that every penny counts. We want to be there for the Higgins Family in the same way that they support, uplift, and love each of us. Pete Higgins was loved by so many different people. He was a coach, a role-model, a mentor, and a friend. Pete was an inspiration, and his legacy will continue to live on.Regardless of what you can donate, we ask you to remember three things as we move forward in this uncertain world: “Show up! Have your stuff! Give an effort!” - Pete HigginsLove, healing, and blessings to all.Thank you so much for any and all support. We love you. Sincerely, Friends of Catie Higgins

During his short time on this earth, Evan shared his infectious personality and huge smile with every one he knew. He did nothing but enjoy life and was an avid hockey player and San Jose Sharks fan. Evan was a dedicated Airman for the US Air Force, a firefighter for the last ten years serving Beale Air Force Base and Red Bluff Fire Dept.,  and had just started his new career as a Shasta County Correctional Deputy this past Fall.Evan leaves behind his parents, Mike and Lori Baxter, his sisters Janelle (Aaron) Wolfsberger and Christen (Benjamin) Brand, nieces Avery and Kinley Wolfsberger, Cali Brand, and nephew Parker Brand. He also leaves behind his best friend and wife, Anne. Anne is expecting their first child this September, to be named Blake Evan after his father.  Evan was beyond excited to become a dad- a girl dad or boy dad, he was just excited. He wanted to be a part of every step of the pregnancy; no matter how major or minor; every doctor's appointment, choosing decorations for the nursery, baby movement on the belly, morning sickness- all of it. When he found out he was having a boy, in true Evan fashion, he said that he was just excited to be a dad. But, knowing Ev, having a boy meant the world. He talked about taking him to hockey practice, signing him up for soccer, taking him to day care, even saying if he wanted to be a cheerleader (Anne is a high school cheer coach), that he would be the best and loudest cheer dad there was. This Baxter Scholarship Fund has been set up to make sure no matter what path in life Baby Boy Baxter decides to take, he will be covered no matter what. Donations go directly to the account that has been set up in Evan's honor for his son: Baxter Scholarship Fund at Golden Valley Bank, Redding, CA. If you prefer to make a donation via check, they can be made out to Baxter Scholarship Fund and mailed to Baxter Scholarship Fund, c/o Golden Valley Bank, 250 Hemsted Dr., Suite 100, Redding, CA 96002. If you would like to donate or help Baby Blake in another way, the baby registry link is babylist.com/babybaxter03** This fundraiser has been organized by Marissa Lemoine and Bryan Zuurbier on behalf of Evan and Anne Baxter. We are both  longtime and close family friends of the Baxter and Woodstrom families. This scholarship fund will allow Evan's son to pursue the career of his choice- college, military, trade school, etc. We are working directly with Anne and Golden Valley Bank where the scholarship account was set up the morning of June 25th, where all funds raised on this platform will directly be transferred.

Rico never hesitates to help others in need, support his family and his community, and spread positivity and love. Rico serves fanta shots at Shellback daily with a smile on his face, regardless of the hardships in his personal life.

I'm Kylie (on the right), and this is Ada (left). And we're getting married.A few years ago, neither of us dreamed we'd be here, as a queer/trans transnational couple. And now that we are, it's wonderful! It's also complicated.

I live in Chicago, Illinois, U.S.A. Ada lives in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Our wedding is in November. Because of COVID, it's going to be smaller than we'd like, with fewer of our loved ones there than we would like. But we're both absolutely thrilled to enter this part of our lives!

That's where the challenges start, though. We have to re-separate almost immediately after the marriage. We have to go through the immigration process, with its fees and document requirements and waiting periods. I need to get a visa approved, to be reunited, and I have a waiting time before I'd be able to legally work in Canada. I have to be approved to practice law in Ontario, since my bar license doesn't work there. We have to find a place to live together. And of course there are the practical costs of moving across a closed border.

These challenges are really, really exciting! And we look forward to facing them together. But every step will be easier, and safer, with your help. This is our reunification fund. While we can't invite everyone - or really, anyone - to be a part of the ceremony, we would be deeply honored if you would be a part of our journey in building our new life together.

This is, for better or worse, still a GoFundMe, and it's our responsibility to provide our goals and needs. The concrete goals we've set post-ceremony are:Immigration/Visa Proceedings (administrative and legal costs);Relocation (on-ground moving and subsistence costs);Licensure (application fees, testing fees, and bar exam fees); andCohabitation (deposit on an apartment or a house, and furnishing).

Each of these bears costs, and they aren't trivial. Filing for sponsorship and permanent residency alone begins at $1050.00 USD. In lieu of gifts or travel, we ask for your assistance in meeting those practical costs. This is also our promise that funds received will go towards these goals. We have no intention of taking the money and going on a vacation - let's face it, there really isn't anywhere to go.

This is also why we haven't provided specific fundraising targets. Your participation in this new stage of our lives is a kindness on your part. We don't want to set an obligation to donate or incentivize it. We sure don't want anyone to decide whether or not this endeavor was a success based upon fundraising. It's already a success to have gotten this far. What it isn't is a way to bully friends into buying us registry paraphernalia (Solid Brass Duck Press, $2999, Williams Sonoma). Our initial goal is set at $15,000, a number that we believe should be sufficient to cover foreseeable immigration fees, visa fees, the costs of moving, the cost of downtime prior to work permission, and, with luck, the cost of any unforeseen eventualities.

We'll progressively update with more concrete goals as we develop them. That may be ""put a deposit on an apartment and buy a sofa."" With luck, it may be ""put a down payment on a home."" It may just be ""reunite,"" which would itself be amazing. Whatever it is, we'll update to let you know exactly what your kindness helped us achieve. If anyone would like more specific fund-management details, I am happy to provide those as well.

We're both fortunate to have met one another, and we're fortunate to be supported by absolutely exceptional folks. We draw friendship and companionship from a broad spectrum of many different communities. We owe our health and lives to you, and we'd be very, very grateful if you'd all walk with us on these next steps of our journey.

She has spent time at St.Judes Children's Hospital and here in Austin at Dell Children's Hospital undergoing extensive surgeries and treatments. Katey is a graduate of Leander High School where she was a proud Blue Belle and even through all of her hospital stays has still kept up and succeeded with her classes at Texas State University. Everyone who knows Katey, knows what a special young lady she is.  Katey met Austin in middle school and after her first surgery, they reconnected on Facebook. They went on their first date the following January on Katey's birthday and they they have been together ever since. He has been right be her side through all of this and they are truly a picture of what unconditional love is. On April 23, 2020, Katey went in for a routine scan and port surgery, and the doctors found 3 new spots on her brain. The doctors told Katey's family, her precious parents Ken and Belinda Malin, that  it won't be years but months that sweet Katey has left.  Austin, Katey's boyfriend made the decision to propose and Katey SAID YES! We are all so happy for Austin and Katey, that even in the midst of all of this, LOVE WINS. Austin and Katey will be married in Burnet, TX on July 18, 2020. As you can imagine, with medical bills, planning a wedding could be stressful and we want to not only take that stress away, but we want to make it THE DREAM WEDDING for Katey and Austin. We also want this money to be used for Austin and Katey to experience as much as they can and make as many memories together as possible. Let's join together, family and friends of the Malin's and Austin and help make this dream come true for a very special young lady and a beautiful couple that deserves the world.

As a new family, we feel strongly called to be good stewards of our resources. For this reason, rather than a traditional registry, we have set up a fundraiser for the Belwop Rescue Center and Children’s Home. Belwop gives hope and a home to the abused, neglected, and orphaned children of Nyeri county, Kenya. Started in 2005 by Veronica Mumbi, Belwop began and continues as an orphanage that creates an environment to foster learning, personal growth and equal rights. Belwop has grown over the years, helping countless children and developing many projects to meet the needs of children and young people throughout the local community. The Belwop name comes from the idea that even without formal identification, such as a birth certificate or even a recorded name, a child can still have an identity, a home and a future. Central to Belwop’s work is its Rescue Centre. The Belwop Rescue Centre gives orphaned, neglected and abused children a home where they are able to grow up with a loving mom, a great education and a stable home life.Paige visited Belwop in 2018 and absolutely fell in love with these amazing kids and the mission of Belwop, and we’ve done our best to stay involved and support the mission ever since. Chris and Paige have frequent calls with Veronica to check in, and before the “great replanning” we were excited to have Veronica join us on 10-10 in Santa Barbara. After COVID, we hope to visit Belwop again. We hope that we can redirect the generosity of our friends and family to this amazing cause, so that our wedding can be not only a celebration of our new marriage, but can be of an incredible impact to these children.We know that this is a challenging time for many, and we do not want anyone to feel obligated to give. But if you do feel inclined to help us start our marriage off on a strong foundation, there is nothing that would make the two of us happier than getting to support this amazing organization.Some logistics:Belwop is a partner of Extreme Response International, which handles the fundraising in the US for Belwop. We’ve been in touch with the CFO of Extreme Response to arrange that the donations from our wedding fundraiser will be destined for Belwop. To make giving as easy as possible, we’ve set up a GoFundMe connected directly to Extreme Response. Extreme Response is a registered not-for-profit organization in the United States, Canada, Ecuador, the Philippines and South Africa, so it may be that your donations are tax deductible (check with your favorite tax professional!). If you work for a company that does donation matching, you can amplify your impact by using your company's matching donation portal, just be sure to add in the comments of your donation to Extreme Response that it is a part of the Brenner Eubank wedding fundraiser and that the funds should be destined for Belwop.Thanks again for all the love and support during these tough times. We hope that together we can plant a seed for Belwop that will benefit for years to come. We love you all!Chris and Paige

Why Denmark? Denmark is one of the easiest and fastest countries in Europe to get married.We have set up a GoFundMe page to help with the costs if anybody would like to kindly support us.  The cost includes flights from the US and UK to Denmark, wedding costs, lodging, transportation, and food.As of today, no official date is set until we can come close receiving the funding needed to help make this come to fruition.Thank you to all who have helped to make our dreams come true!

We have reorganized and embraced a new version of our Covid-Era Nuptials. Many of you have asked about gifts or if we have a registry. We appreciate your generosity and we have thought of something that will commemorate the nuptials, our community and this crazy time:We are commissioning a wedding mural via Paint the Void! The mural will commemorate our ceremony and will be painted on boards and displayed at a local business that has been shut down d/t COVID19. Once that business reopens, the mural will be touched up and moved to its forever-home in our living room!We have chosen local artist Jordan Herren  to do the piece.  Jordan is an Asian-American Bay Area native and a fantastic street artist. He has agreed to come to our ceremony to get a first-hand view of the scene, and then use his artistic talents to make a colorful and memorable mural so we can remember it forever. Paint the Void  (news ) has been our partner in facilitating this art.  It's a COVID-era non-profit, started in March of 2020, that has the mission of beautifying San Francisco in this dark time by commissioning local artists to paint murals on boarded-up businesses all across the Bay Area. It adds beauty while giving talented artists real work. We are huge fans.  Special thanks to our dear friend Inga Bard for putting in extra work to make this happen. All proceeds will go to Paint the Void and Jordan. We feel that this is a win-win-win for us, our community, and the Bay Area in general. We get to support a local non-profit, a local artist, and beautify a local business that has been impacted by COVID19. And PLUS we get a cherished memento of our special day. We love you all, and we appreciate your support and generosity!!   Firen & Brady PS - Jordan's Paint the Void Mural.

Hello everyone, my name is Kongcheng Kimyang. This past May 31st, I got marry to the most beautiful and loving woman I know, Haju Kimyang, the love of my life who came from across the ocean literally. She is intelligent, independent, strong, joyful, diligent, faithful, hardworking, and always humble before God. Haju is a woman who knows how to love others around her and knows how to be there for them. She always helps me to be a better man before God and before others. 

Haju and I met in 2016 our freshman year of college. She always tried her best to do the work God gave her. No matter if that’s working, studying, or loving others, she always have done her best. We have gone through some hardships after I proposed to Haju in 2019. Our engagement season was filled with unmeasurable amount of tears and desperate prayers. We prayed God to give us wisdom and peace to go through that season. There were so much unbearable difficulties in our lives especially for Haju. The pain was killing her from the inside. I had to watch her almost losing the light and joys which always sparkled in her eyes. It was one of the most painful times of my life watching the love of my life losing her passion for the Church, smiles, and hating herself and others from the deep end. She was not the bright and joyful person I knew. Depression and anxiety took her over. By the grace of God, so many people around us helped Haju to fight that pain back. I witnessed how God heals our pain and redeems our darkness with my bear eyes through Haju’s recovery. She bravely fought that suffocating depression and anxiety that were taking her breath away. She and I finished our undergrad this April and she finished it off the program with summa cum laude. Sadly, COVID took our precious graduation ceremony away and also messed up our wedding plan that was supposed to be on the 1st of May. Her biggest disappointment was her family had to cancel their flight due to COVID. She was sad on the rehearsal day not having her mom right next to her. But through all these chaotic moments, God taught us how we are to trust God and depend on Him in every situation. Now, we are married and we are still going strong before God, now as a married couple. This month, we are facing a big step as a newlywed. Haju’s student visa allows 60 days of grace period upon graduation which will end this month. Our original plan got messed up completely because of COVID-19, and now we are in a lot of needs. Originally, we were thinking of applying for Haju’s green card towards at the end of this year (2020) as we will work and have to save application fee and extra charges which is close to $5000. So, Haju applied for a work visa and still waiting for the approval. However, due to the pandemic, now the government is considering closing off the OPT program (US college graduates work permit upon graduation) and we are not sure if the application will go through or not. Because of this, we now have to apply for her green card as soon as we can before this month ends to make sure that she can stay in the US with me. If her visa just expires without any other visa, she will have to leave to Korea which will cost more money and time, and especially a long, unpredictable time away from each other right after we got married. Your donation will go to pay the application fee and attorney fee, to help us paying other bills, and also to help our new start as a married couple because we are in a very tight financial situation. Any amount of help will make a big difference in our lives.

This weekend (Sept. 18) my brother Erick (aka Bro) and his Fiancé Corwina had their house broken into, ransacked and robbed.  In addition to their passports, personal belongings and other items, they had all the money they had been saving up for their 2021 wedding and honeymoon stolen from them.  They have insurance that covers damages and some of the items that were taken, after deductible, but insurance does not cover any stolen cash.

During these hard times they have been working extra and long hours to scrape and save money for their wedding and their FUTURE.   They wanted a good safety net  to protect them. They both work so very hard and I’m heartbroken and want to do something to help my wonderful brother. As a lot of you know, my brother and Corwina are very giving individuals who are constantly helping others and never asking for anything in return.   During the wild fires they let several families who had to be evacuated stay with them.  This is one of many examples.  

They would never do a Go Fund Me on their own because that is just not who they are.   I’ve not told my brother I’m doing this.  I know there are many of you out there that they have helped and touched your lives..... and perhaps some of you would like to pay it forward and lend them a helping hand

We (Chelsea and Nick) are getting married. Due to the pandemic, it will be a quiet ceremony in our backyard with no guests. Since we already have a comfortable home and plenty of appliances, and there is no way we can go on a honeymoon in the near future, we are accepting donations in the spirit of our love to help establish our company Modern Mythology Press.We already have published Nick's novel ""Hitomi"" and will publish Chelsea's upcoming poetry book ""I've Had Lovers"". In the next few years, we'd like to publish anthologies from new writers, and offer advances to some of those writers to develop their own manuscripts. We will focus on writers who advance new thought-forms and push them forward, with particular emphasis on marginalized voices.

The money from this fundraiser will go to stipends to writers, and printing costs for new publications.

From volunteering, missionary work, and international missions trips, to operating an Independent Record Label and working towards a bachelor's degree etc. the Lord has used our yes in a way we never could’ve imagined. But it hasn't been a walk in the park. Our faith HAS BEEN tested; along with God showing us tremendous accounts of supernatural provision on our faith walk journey, such as:1) Providing us both with plane tickets to serve Bushveld Mission Children's Home in South Africa ✈️2) Providing food, gas, bills, emergencies in different ways on a monthly basis3)Enabling us to start paying off our debts 4)Engagement ring etc.This marriage is definitely a new chapter of our faith walk.

Hopefully everyone else was able to enjoy the Zoom version of the wedding ceremony. The day was perfect, and although we had a small physical audience we could feel the love of everyone thinking of us on our special day. We absolutely do not expect wedding gifts from anybody but have had many very generous people in our lives wanting to give gifts. Because of that we decided to put together this go fund me page in lieu of a registry. If you can give anything at all towards our running water fund we would greatly appreciate it but of course nothing is expected.We have been living in our northwoods home for 3 years now and have slowly been making additions to our farm. We raise goats, sheep, chickens, turkeys, ducks, and a vegetable garden while also growing microgreens year round. All this time we have been hauling the majority of our water from the artesian well in Washburn and catching rainwater off our roof. This has been a great way to offset the need for a gym membership but isn't the most efficient system.To celebrate this beautiful moment of our lives, we have decided to have a well dug on our property. This will save us from late night trips to well and chipping away at the ice volcano that forms around the well after several straight months of sub-freezing temperatures. Our coworkers, friends, and family will appreciate our increased ability to shower much more frequently! Thank you all so very much!

Mikell’s initial plan was to invite people over to their building's rooftop after the engagement and order in some pizzas, but we are hoping to surprise them with something way better!As you know, Jen is a master of planning. She is incredible at bringing people together and figuring out the ideal schedule to keep everyone entertained. Unfortunately for Jen, an engagement party is the one thing she can't plan for herself. But that’s where we come in! If we all come together we can surprise them both with a night that is truly one to remember, and hopefully up to Jen's high standards ;)The truth is that Jen and Mikell are both remarkable people who have made every right decision along the way and consistently put others before themselves. Right now they are both the only ones in their families who are currently employed and this has undoubtedly put pressure on them. They have made large financial sacrifices to keep family afloat, and while they are willing to compromise on things like an engagement party, this can be a moment where we show up for them and blow them away with a night that we will all enjoy together.All funds will go towards venue, food+drinks, music, and ambiance for creating a special intimate evening. If there happens to be any leftover funds it will be put onto a gift card that Jen and Mikell can use to finish furnishing their new apartment.Here is a link to the venue we are hoping to book: https://www.peerspace.com/pages/listings/5a723c7c86febbf101ca3a04?sort_order=2We will continue to update this page with progress as plans solidify, and also welcome any ideas and alternative ways of contributing.PLEASE DO NOT SHARE THIS LINK WITH ANYONE AND KEEP CONFIDENTIAL SO THIS CAN REMAIN A SURPRISE!Cheers,Je'kell Engagement Party Planning Committee

Krystal and Robert are both missionaries in Germany. They are getting married. They literally don’t have any furniture for their apartment.  They have been gifted a place for a honeymoon, but spending money is minimal. She has been skimping in her wedding as well. We want to bless the socks off these amazing people that are so generous with their finances and life to serve the Lord.  Let’s serve them back. 

Here’s a bit of their story:

Robert comes from a complicated past with a lifestory that will need to be made into a book someday. I am constantly impressed by how much he has spent life discovering truth and solutions and then turning to face even the difficult things head-on. God has been with him and walked every step of the way even before he was fully conscious of this role God was having in his life. Krytal comes from a deeply-rooted Christian (Nazarene) family. She says ""I have never questioned the truth of God and only had the task of making Him my own God, not just my family’s... which is also a bit of an adventure, because life with Jesus always is!""Robert had lived in various countries on four continents, taken on various jobs, and mostly meeting lots of interesting people! In 2014 he attended a service with “Kirche in Aktion” (literally ""Church in Action"") the Sunday after meeting some of their members at a nightclub and feeling like there was “something different” about them (side note - one of the guys there that night opened his own atelier as a gold smith and he is the one that made their wedding rings!). Robert heard a testimony that deeply moved him and he began to volunteer for the church. He was baptized in a pool at a church retreat and soon was asked about pursuing full-time ministry. He accepted the call and gave up his start-up company and other career options.When Krystal reflects on her life, she realizes in awe and wonder how gracious God has been:""I had always expected marriage to be around the corner for me and was a bit baffled as to why I was 40, pursuing what God had for me (which was first learning and living in a dynamic Christian community in Seattle and then being called to Portugal for ministry) and still single. I thought i would be ministering in Portugal for the rest of my life... until there were a series of events, including a dream that lead to a direct pointing of me attending the Church in Action new year’s retreat where He confirmed that i should move and work with Church in Action. It is also the retreat where Robert had been baptized 4 years earlier and as he had since become a city pastor with Kirche in Aktion, it is also where we met for the first time. My mom had spent my whole life praying for the person I would marry. After the new year’s party I returned home to the United States and in that short trip my mother was diagnosed with leukemia and after a long, but short 3 weeks she passed away. She never met the person I was to marry, but he and i had met each other before she went to heaven. We can’t help but wonder how much of us coming together is really a testimony to the power of prayer. The obvious way God led me to Church in Action meant I knew without doubt that despite wanting to stay and be near my dad and brother after my mom’s death I needed to continue with the move from Portugal to Germany. During the time i moved a group of pastors, including Robert, were finishing their masters thesis AND it just so happened that Robert was writing his about coffee shop ministry... which is exactly what I had been doing in Portugal for the last seven years! So, obviously, we needed to work together a bit and meet up often! Months later we started dating and here we are today, marrying on my mom’s birthday, which happens to fall on a Sunday this year - the day of the week I have dreamed of marrying. Is there more to this story? Obviously! I haven’t even mentioned Covid-19 and cultural things! But the biggest part of the story is how two people from across the globe, but built for each other, have been lured by the grace of God into each others lives after 40 years of life and what that might mean for the rest of their lives together!!! There is no reason to wait any longer!

Three years later he was proposing to her in the Boston Public Garden. They both began planning their big Indian wedding. They chose the International Golf Course in Bolton, Massachusetts as their wedding venue for its beautiful scenery of the outdoor golf courses and the reception room right on the property.Just 2 months before the wedding on May 30th, the Covid-19 pandemic hit. Andrew and Nisha thought their wedding might possibly get postponed but hoped for the best. Outfits had been purchased and sewn. Invites had been sent out.Everything changed at the end of March when they found out from a news article that their wedding venue was closing down and would not be reopening after the pandemic. No one at the International Golf Course would answer phones or emails. Just radio silence. Then just last week the club filed for bankruptcy. After talking with attorneys and other couples who were to have their wedding at the International as well, Andrew and Nisha began to realize that they would not be seeing a penny back of the $10,000 they had already paid the club.Not only had they been saving this money for 2 years during their engagement, but everything had been planned. They have been robbed. And now the happiest day of what would be any couple’s life is ruined.I live with my brother Andrew and his fiancé Nisha. I have personally watched the toll this has taken on them. Neither of them even want a wedding anymore. This has left them both so incredibly sad and angry.I really hesitated even posting a fundraiser for them because I know everyone is really going through tough times during this pandemic. I know many people don’t have jobs or any extra money at the moment. That said, I’ve had numerous friends and family reach out wanting to help these two wonderful people and decided to create a formal way to do so for those that are able. Any money raised will be used for a small wedding at some point in the future if they decide to have one or for wedding gifts that would have been given had they had a wedding

This is very important to us in order to strengthen the family bonds and not to forget all those who cannot come celebrate the Wedding itself.Thank you so much, and we appreciate your involvement in our lives as well as our special day!

We have tried to get everything done with the smallest budget possible but wedding expenses stack up pretty fast. (Who knew!?) Unfortunately we are running out of time and money so any money received will go towards purchasing the last few things necessary to make sure our wedding goes off without a hitch and anything left over will go towards planning our honeymoon.We know times are tough and most of you may not exactly be in a position to be able to donate and we COMPLETELY understand. We are just asking that if you wanted to gift us anything don't sweat trying to pick out a gift, please donate if you can. With love,Cheyenne & Jacob

In the meantime, Rich, a carpenter, is working on constructing our home by creating two separate dwellings inside of his family's current house.  We are asking for your help to ensure the apartment construction is finished by the end of the year so we can live together as a married couple.BACKGROUNDIn the spring of 2019, Rich and his parents, Rich Sr. and Pam Feeley, purchased 3 acres in beautiful Chimacum, WA, along with a 2600 square foot house.  The plan all along was to divide the house into two separate living quarters - one for Pam and Rich and one to rent out to a prospective tenant. Then I (Jessica) walked into the picture! And plans changed. Now the apartment-to-be is where I will live and eventually where Rich and I will live. Right now Rich lives in his RV on the property he shares with his parents. I live in a cabin on Discovery Bay, about 20 minutes away.For many months, Rich has been steadily and singlehandedly working on the construction and remodeling job.  He is transforming the master bedroom and a spare bedroom into one self contained unit with a kitchen, bathroom, bedroom and side room.  He is additionally transforming the former living room into his parents' new bedroom while also ripping out the carpet throughout the house and laying wooden floors. It really is a colossal job.Rich works full-time as a cashier at the Kearney co-op.  He also fulfills small carpentry jobs for community members. For example, he recently built a deck for a local couple.  This means that the time he has to work on our house is limited and every minute counts.  With the money we raise, we will purchase building materials and hire an assistant carpenter who could help Rich multiply his efforts, speed along the remodeling and transform the current house into a multi-generational dwelling.  After our wedding, Rich plans to dive into the house project in earnest. With help, we are hoping this work will take 3 more months - October, November and December - and be completed by the end of the year.To honor your generosity as our donors, we will create a plaque in our apartment with the names of every single person who contributes no matter how much.  This plaque will be a permanent fixture representing that you our friends and family made it possible for this dwelling to become our home. Every time we see it, we will be reminded that our relationship literally lives inside of the love of our community as our lives together evolve and flourish. Thank you in advance for your generous help!

Hello loved ones! So many of you have asked about a registry since we got married on March 22, 2019. We had planned to put one together before our celebration on Bowen’s Island in September, which we sadly had to cancel due to the pandemic. 

We are asking that in lieu of wedding gifts that you would consider donating so we can make a second car a reality. We truly have all we need in the household department, and a honeymoon doesn’t seem to be happening anytime soon with the way the world is. The pandemic has shook us all to the core and we would love folks’ support in helping us build our future here on the east coast.

New Mexicans think it was invented in Santa Fe; Texans, in San Antonio. When Anthony Bourdain calls it “warm crap in a bag,” who should be insulted? Jason and I vow to get to the bottom of one of the biggest mysteries of the universe and we’d like your help. On August 1st we will bravely embark upon a journey across a new world. A world that at times will be unwelcome to strangers and will close their doors on us. But we won’t give up! We’ll travel far and wide to bring back the answers we all deserve. We've saved some money for this quest but need your help to take us all the way. With your modest donation we'll be able to purchase new gear to sustain ourselves and both literal and metaphorical fuel for our journey. SO HERE'S THE TRUTH.... I absolutely LOVE Frito pie. I’m Texan, its in my blood. It's the only reason I ever attended a football game in high school. And while I wouldn’t mind knowing it's history, the reality is that it was invented and we all get to enjoy it, and thats all that matters. More than finding out answers to questions that don’t matter,  I’d really love for Jason and I to get to take whatever honeymoon we can as newlyweds. A road trip honeymoon wasn’t what we’d planned on, but we know we can turn it into something truly special and memorable. And while we didn’t get to have our wedding at Basecamp 37 this year we are still going there in August to work for a few weeks. We'd like to turn the drive there and the drive back into the best mini moon we can! We aren’t seeking to lavish ourselves at restaurants or stay in fancy resorts with couples massages. As you all know we prefer to camp under the stars and cook each other dinner. We’d love your help acquiring some new gear for the trip (like a new tent, a portable stove and camp cooking stuff, a roof cargo box to put all that stuff in, and new bad ass tires for our truck so we can go drive on all the crazy roads) and generally to just help alleviate the stress of spending money on something that, especially given the worlds climate, we absolutely know is not a necessity, but is instead a desire. We know times are tough for everyone. Most of you, like us, haven’t had jobs or income in months.  And most of you, like us, have donated what little you do have to reparations and mutual aid. We’re not asking for much, truly whatever you’re able and willing to give would be greatly appreciated. We won't any point be having a traditional registry, so apart from joining us next summer for our celebration this will be the only gift we would like to ask for. And any extra funds we have will go towards that celebration!  And if you can’t donate money to our cause that's totally ok! We’ll gladly accept a playlist from you to accompany us on our journey. Jason can’t sing the whole time and there are only so many episodes of true crime podcasts one can listen to. We love you dearly and cannot wait to celebrate our love for each other and for you next summer in the desert. And lastly we promise, that we WILL have Frito pie both on our honeymoon AND at our celebration with you in Utah. All our love, Neanna & Jason

We got married in celebration of the love we have for one another but that was only part of the process. Now, we are engaged in a long and complicated legal journey that costs over 4,000 dollars to complete. Luciana does not have the right to work in the United States with her current legal status, which makes it  harder for her to get the money together for this process. We are currently vulnerable to be separated by ICE enforcement agents or immigration police right now while her VISA status remains unchanged. This causes a lot of anxiety for us, as the life we are making could be destroyed and Luciana's living situation could change dramatically without notice. We also cannot fly within the country with this situation. Unfortunately, between us, we do not have the money to pay for this right now.  We want to resolve this as fast as possible. Luciana has many artistic collaborations that she is excited to explore in Atlanta, as well as her partnership and friendships with the people she has gotten close to here. We want to make it possible for her to live in peace and have the rights necessary to be successful. Below, is a link to a performance that we did called ´Mating Dance´in which we danced in celebration of our love inspired by the mating rituals of animals and insects. Watch if you would like. https://youtu.be/6ENBGKNSjJUIf you donate more than $500, we would like to extend the opportunity to you for us to come and do a private performance for you in a locale of your choosing. If you donate more than $250, we will send you our most recent Osos Peligrosos recording which is in the process of being edited called ´Haxan.´ We will also send a small visual arts collaboration that we make together for you if you would like.Thank you so much for your time and support. We love you,Besos Rafa y Luci

I am in a loving committed relationship with my partner, Patrick. We would like to get married so Patrick can legally speak for me when the time comes when I can't make my own healthcare choices, like life support. But more important to me is that our souls will forever be linked for eternity. Patrick and I have seen a 70+ percent loss of income due to the pandemic and can't afford a wedding. We would like to drive to Las Vegas and get married in a civil ceremony and spend the weekend. We'd like to elope on Halloween, so we need to raise money as soon as possible to make this happen. I have never been one to ask for help or even admit that I need help, but any love and support you can give us will make our miracle happen. See, at a time in my life when I am facing my own mortality and a very unpleasant death from cancer, I wake up every day grateful because Patrick fills  my every moment with love and support and because of him I will not have to face this alone. This money will cover our food, transportation, hotel, the wedding ceremony, and the $77. license fee. And it will make our dream a reality. Thank you all for taking the time to read this and know that we will forever be grateful for you kindness, support, and blessings.

Hello everyone! Due to COVID19 our honeymoon trip to Spain has been cancelled; we are pretty bummed but will be taking a trip to Florida instead! If you want to give money towards our trip to help us “live it up” in Florida a little extra, we would be very grateful! And hopefully someday, when things return to normal, we can take our dream trip to Spain.

We came into 2020 planning our beautiful wedding for the fall.  Little did we know COVID-19 would rearrange our plans entirely.  We had to come to a hard decision to postpone our wedding because we did not want family from around the country to chance their health.  Sadden as we were we just decided to put it on the back burner for the foreseeable future.

THEN, our beautiful friends at Phocus Photography invited us to be models for their wedding editorial shoot they were planning.  Jokingly,  Mackenzie said “shoot can you just marry us then.” And they went full steam ahead.  We eloped at a beautiful venue with zebras, peacocks and kangaroos in the background. Mackenzie got to pick out a beautiful dream dress that would have been out of our original budget.  I got a to wear an awesome tux along with some groovy shoes.  Not to mention the flowers were something from a dream and partnered with all the rentals(arbors, chairs etc).  It was seriously beautiful. We have said many times it was our dream day minus our loved ones. May 18, 2020 was a day that we will both treasure.  We have been overwhelmed with the amount of love and congratulations we have received.  We realized we have not even thought about or begun to execute a wedding registry until many people asked. In saying this, we would greatly appreciate any monetary gifts. We dont know what the future holds and to be honest this little 2 bedroom apartment is busting at the seams.Again, thank you to everyone who has taken the time to wish us well on our new beautiful chapter. We appreciate anything that you can put  to our happiest ever after

You've arrived at David & Connor's gofundmeWedding registry page. Thursday December 3rd 2020 will be our Wedding Day.We'd be very appreciative and thankful if those of you who can and would like to gift us, would do so by funding us on here for our future exciting plans together:We are planning a side business and would love help in the endeavour. With all the uncertainty in the world; one thing we do know is that learning about people and sharing our cooking is important to us. We would love to travel around the United States and live that ‘Van life’. 

Yes! this is our little family's idea of the perfect Honeymoon together.

What we are working toward is a camper and food trailer set up that we can use to make food and travel this country with. To accomplish this we need to pay toward the trailer, the camper van and initial start up.  A film crew would be amazing, too. Working on that part.We plan on getting in lots of good trouble while travelling with our puppy companions; Bacon & Bourbon. This is in conjunction with The Bull Valley Roadhouse (or not if things head that way in this pandemic life.)

When we are done traveling, we will settle somewhere, in California ideally, be it back in Port Costa or elsewhere. The world is your oyster, after all.Also important to us is paying it forward and helping out those in need. Which is why we pledge with this new endeavour to give a portion of our profits towards causes that are important. Please see the links below for initiatives we plan to support:

Kino Border Initiative is making humane migrationbetween US and Mexico a reality Know Your Rights Camp empowers Black and Brown communities

Informed Immigrant is a resource hub for information and organizations in all 50 states 

True Colors united - help and advocacy for LGBTQ homeless youthFinally; thank you in advance from the very depths of our human and our puppies hearts for supporting us, we know that everyone is doing it tough right now.

For us; going forward with ingenuity and integrity over having stuff and things is integral, and if we can brighten someone’s day in the process then that’s a bonus. We are really excited and looking forward to sharing this journey with you all.

With love from The Willings;Bacon, Bourbon, David & Connor xxxxoooo

Every card had been opened and whatever blessing was in it was now gone. They are devastated and now put in a financial bind with trying to regroup on what seem like nothing. However we stand firmly on God's word..That he would supply all of our needs with his riches in Glory...So in spite of the unfortunate situation we are believing God at his word we that have not because we ask not. They are way to humbled to be greedy so I am asking for them, to ask that you find it in your heart to bless this beautiful union.

 ""The picture Included here is a prime example of not only what Sabumnim stands for, but why my wife and I KNEW this was the school and the Master with whom my son should begin his martial arts journey with. My son was given a citizenship award at school and Sabumnim was so emphatic about the fact that it should be celebrated even though my son hadn’t mentioned it during the dojang afterschool program.Prior to joining WMAC, I had reached out to a few schools when my son was 4 and a half years old, and they all said that they didn’t start training children that early. Undaunted, I came to WMAC. I’ll never forget the day in 2015 when I came to the dojang on a Saturday afternoon and Sabumnim was just about to leave. We talked for about 45 minutes.I expressed my desire to have my son start training early, as I wished I  had, and how important it was for young Black boys to develop not just martial arts training but the discipline, awareness, and sensitivity to equip themselves for the unique challenges they would face. We were speaking each other’s language as Brooklyn-bred men of color. I knew this was the place for us. To my joy and surprise, the diversity of dojang students and instructors was more than I ever expected. The adaptation to needs, skill sets, and particular challenges has been a blessing and a joy. The Chungsanims even motivated me to get back to my own training regardless of my physical challenges (which had been my personal crutch for years). I can’t for a minute imagine what we would do without WMAC, Sabumnim and the community.#Lifechanging #necessary #cantdowithout""  -Kurt The World Martial Arts Center started over 30 years ago to teach self-defense and empower women. Seeing the rapid skill development of these women, the men around them were inspired to join us. Since that time, many of the members have gotten married and had children and we created a children's program that has grown to a seven day a week program, with an emphasis on self-esteem, self-image, self-respect and self-confidence. WMAC has received seven prestigious national top ten martial arts school awards and besides having 60% female instructors, it is one of the few schools in New York City to produce women masters in traditional Korean Hapkido and VSK Combat Street Jujitsu.This is a place where families train together, little boys learn to respect and value little girls as their equal. And little girls learn to hold their own, with complete confidence amongst any group of boys. At our school, we build character and teens respect and admire their parents.WMAC is an empowerment generating force in the community for men, women and children regardless of socio-economic backgrounds. It is a place where Black Lives Matter, where a Hasidic Jew, Egyptian Muslim, a Chinese Buddhist and an Irish Catholic can train together and bond as brothers and sisters of the human family tree. The pandemic has decimated seventy percent of our student body which has made it impossible for us to maintain and operate our school. We are forced to leave our present location and we need your help to establish a new location and save our school. For the first time in 30 years a school that was started with $38 and no bank loans, that not only thrived but supported countless others in fulfilling their goals and life dreams, and has reached down to lift so many up now is reaching up for a hand to pull them back onto solid high ground so that we can continue being a true force for good for humanity.This is an urgent and time sensitive appeal to save our school and maintain a place of empowerment for all in these disempowering times.Your donation means so much to us and as a thank you,If you donate $50 or more you get access to a virtual beginners' guide which includes the complete beginners' program $100 or more you get access to the virtual beginners' guide  and the 12 guided meditations $500 or more you get all of the above plus exclusive access to a special, live, virtual weapon training with the Grandmaster (includes five preparation videos prior to the workshop)

We want to see generations of boys continue to make Deerhorn their summer destination. Without these funds, this may not happen, so our ask is genuine and it touches each and every one of us. In response to COVID-19 and the necessary closing down of Summer 2020 Camp Deerhorn sessions, the Broadbridge families are practicing what they have always preached to our sons; ""to try to see the other fellow's side of the question...” To demonstrate this, Deerhorn has offered families that could not donate their 2020 deposit the option to roll-over, or request an eventual refund of these funds. This promise is outside the terms we all agree to when we complete our annual application for camp. Deerhorn relies on these deposits for fixed costs that the camp incurs year after year. These costs have not vanished, even though Summer 2020 will not happen. Refunds create a shortfall today and roll-overs will merely push Deerhorn’s shortfall until 2021. We don't feel that Deerhorn, nor the Broadbridge families should bear this burden alone.We are all in this together! So, we would like to ask the families that can; Help us make up this difference.  Whether your son is a current, past, or even, in-waiting camper, please consider supporting this fundraiser. This Go Fund Me campaign is for all Deerhorn families, including the family that has done so much to develop our sons into Boys and Men of character, resilience, and leadership. Deerhorn will receive these funds directly through an account set up on their behalf via GoFundMe and will use these funds to support all requests for refunds. These are unprecedented times, and we know that many of our fellow Deerhorn families may also be facing significant challenges. If you are unable to help through a donation of your own, we appreciate you taking the time to read this page. We ask you to consider passing the link on to others who might be willing to help. Anyone who knows your son and values the person he is becoming may be willing to stand with your son and donate even a small amount to help us meet this challenge.  Gratefully, Current and Past Families of Deerhorn Campers"

Let's start off with the American dream.  In 1963, Nobuyoshi Higashi came to USA with $20 in his pocket, with the Gi on his back.  He builds a dojo in the basement of the NY Buddhist Church on the UWS of Manhattan.  He pioneers the Judo movement and teaches Judo and martial arts to thousands of people including his son Shintaro.  He hands off the business.  Then Covid happens...What can be said about Covid 19's effect on the martial arts industry that hasn't already been said?  Kokushi Budo has never closed its doors but we have been closed now for 7 months and running due to the savage nature of this beast.  During this time, we've been doing our very best to keep the lights on.Now, It's not in my nature to ask for help but sometimes toxic masculinity needs to take a backseat and I have to be honest with myself.  Will I let Kokushi Budo to die because I am too proud to ask for help?  No, I will not!  2020 has taken me down time and time again.  I've taken breakfall after breakfall and now I need a helping hand to help me get back to my feet.Funds will pay for back rent, expenses, and capital improvements to bring everyone back to training in a safe and government compliant way.  It will help me keep the dream and legacy going, from 1963, 2020, and Beyond.

More than anything, I would I hate the narrative, ""I gave my son the dojo and he ran it into the ground.""  Please help if you can.  I know Covid affected many people and not just me.  If you can't afford to give in donation, please share this.  Greatly appreciated.  See you back on the mats very soon.-Shintaro

We are thankful no injuries occurred, but devastated at the loss of something that helped make the Xi Delta Chapter so special. We are exploring an effort rebuild our barn, but need your help.  As this recently happened, our plans to rebuild are not finalized and no decisions have been made. When they are, the fundraising goal will be adjusted to match what we need. What is clear is that our insurance policy will not be enough to rebuild the barn. The initial goal limit is based on our preliminary expectation of the cost. The housing corporation has not made any decisions on designs of a potential future structure.For 30 years, the Chi Phi barn has been a place for people to come together. We have used it to relax on a weekend; we have used it to bring countless Brothers into our family; we have used the barn to mourn the loss of Brothers no longer with us. We have also used the  barn to welcome thousands of friends into our home. Chi Phi Chapters across Florida and Brothers across the country have visited throughout the years. Some have stayed with us during summers, and they have left with lifelong friendships. We have hosted every Fraternity and Sorority at Florida Tech for one reason or another. For the past 30 years, we have opened our doors to you to celebrate a holiday or to toast to all of our successes after a semester, or even to sit under the shade and enjoy a beautiful day. The Chi Phi barn sat at our house, but it has lived in the hearts and memories of so many of us.I’m sure many of you have some great memory of a time around our barn. Maybe you heard a song that you couldn’t resist dancing to, or a game that you won and still talk about with old friends. The barn could have been the place where you met someone you’ll never forget, or it could have been the place where you fell in love. We ask that you think about what the barn has given you. We understand that the COVID-19 pandemic has put many people in a less secure financial state. We ask, if you are able to do so, that you donate to help in our efforts so that thousands more can experience everything that you have, too.Any money donated through GoFundMe will go directly to funding the barn exploratory project and will not be tax-deductible.Fraternally, The Executive Boards of XDHC and XDAAThe Xi Delta Housing Corporation (XDHC) is an organization run solely by elected alumni of the Xi Delta Chapter of the Chi Phi Fraternity located in Melbourne, FL. All donations will go to XDHC in an effort to explore what future structure could replace the barn. This would eventually include construction costs for a new structure. The fundraiser's donations will be directly withdrawn by the intended recipient.

On May 30, we were the victims of vandalism and complete and total looting as a result of the riots on Broad St., the stretch of Broad St. where my shop is located. Our entire inventory was looted to include all but one of our customers bikes that were in for service (no, it's not your bike. The owner has been notified.) This includes every single wheel and small item that was brought in for service.Before going a sentence further, I must say that on May 30, 2020 I was able to come home to my kids. They came into my bed with me as I laid awake. My sister came to my house just to provide support. George Floyd would never see his kids again and his sister again. And I can't even think about this without crying. He never went home and I did. I need a moment of silence.I have been overwhelmed with support, which is amazing. Many people have offered financial support, so I made this is the GoFundMe for Balance Bicycle Shop. But don't donate to me, GoFund George Floyd and his family instead. I went home to my family and he didn't.https://www.gofundme.com/f/georgefloydBut, if you still want to give to Balance Bicycle Shop, know I am truly grateful. I am actually overwhelmed by emails, text messages, DMs, right now. The generosity of people who I know and love already and the cycling community in Richmond would be enough. But there is an additional outpouring of support from people who I don't know, who I have never met, who have never been in my shop, and who don't even live in Virginia. All of it is humbling.I want give a rough guidelines for what I plan do use your donations for, and the ways your donations will be used to help rebuild Balance Bicycle Shop.10% will go to Richmond Cycling Corps. They do amazing work with at risk youth in Richmond, using cycling as the tool to break down the barriers.  There is nothing more that I can say that hasn't been said or done through their work.  https://www.richmondcyclingcorps.org/Phase 1 rebuilding will start with making my existing customers who have lost their bikes in the looting whole again. Going forward, I am working with our insurance to cover customer's losses. This will take time as we get all the relevant and necessary documents. I hope to build a fund to make my customers whole and repay their loses quicker than insurance. This is Phase 1 in rebuilding, making sure my existing customers are taken care of.Phase 2 rebuilding will be to pay my employees who have no jobs now. My employees are unemployed as a result of the looting. Some of my employees have been with me for years. There is no set length of time for which I want to be able to pay them, but anything will help in a time like this.Next is Phase 3a or Phase 3b. These are speculative because they exist many months into the future. Only one scenario will prevail, and I don't know which one it will be.Phase 3a is actual rebuilding; inventory, cabinets, computers, fixtures, etc. Financially, this will largely be taken care of by insurance. It will take time, effort, man-hours and it will be a fraction of the actual loss in dollar amounts and time. I expect this insurance claim will take 12-18mo.We will not reopen in Richmond City. I can't rebuild in Richmond City. Justifiable rising tensions makes it impossible to rebuild in Richmond City. Police brutality and racism is not going anywhere and the escalating violence and tension in the city make it no longer viable for businesses. Maybe I can rebuild once, but impossible twice. It absolutely pains me to say, but the next murder of an unarmed black person is guaranteed, we just don't know who it is yet. I can't spend the next 6 months of my life rebuilding my business only to get looted again for something I have absolutely no control over.Phase 3b is the end of Balance Bicycle Shop. What happened, the looting, is not just a break-in where we lost a few bikes and otherwise able to resume business in a day or two. This is the complete gutting of my businesses inventory, tools, which we truly can't restock because of supply chain shortages. There is nothing left. We can't resume normal business before the money runs out.  UPDATE: This option was always a last resort but I wanted to be clear it was possible before money was donated.  Based on the response I've gotten from GoFundMe and through other channels, this is not an option.  Rebuilding Balance Bicycle Shop will be the way forward.

Some of our students have come back as parents and even grandparents, passing that joy through generations. We would like to continue this service for 50 years more, but our current circumstances are dire.We've survived the shutdown so far by severely cutting our expenses and using our savings, which are now depleted. The PPP loan we received went only so far and came with heavy restrictions, making it a temporary boost but not a salvation.Even into the fifth month of the shutdown, there are expenses we are obligated to pay. Furthermore, there are things we are unwilling to do to survive.-We are obligated to pay rent of almost $23,000 each month.-We are unwilling to stop paying the furloughed staff’s healthcare premiums that come to $6,500 monthly.-We are obligated to pay other bills which, after reducing by half, amount to $15,000 each month.-We are unwilling to spend money that has been paid to us for services we were not able to render, which means a fair bit of our bank balance is in reserve.We have exhausted our options and are now appealing to our community for help. Any amount you can offer to help get us through the next two months will be dearly appreciated. If you are unable to donate, please consider sharing this fundraiser to get the word out to as many people as possible. If you are a currently enrolled family with a credit on your account, simply letting us know that you would like to donate that credit will be a tremendous help. You can do so by emailing us.We cannot imagine the San Ramon Valley without Diablo Gymnastics School, but we are now in imminent danger of closure. On behalf of our phenomenal staff, adorable students, and fierce, brave, disciplined, amazing team girls, we plead for your assistance. Please help us weather this shut down so we can continue to provide a home to this generation of gymnasts and the future generations to come.

Winners have been picked. Thanks to everyone who donated!Meet Calvin Smith. A former collegiate basketball player, turned competitive cyclist, and a friend. His enthusiasm for growing and diversifying the sport of cycling is contagious and one of the first things we talked about when we first met. Calvin has been fundraising on his own for The Hidden Genius Project — an organization which trains and mentors black male youth in technology creation, entrepreneurship, and leadership skills to help transform their lives and communities —  to help close the ""digital gap"" which affects the Black community at a disproportionate rate. This effort ended yesterday but together we decided to extend his fundraiser, turbo it, and to raise even more money for this important non-profit. How are we going to do that? With help from you and our friends at BOBO’s , Wahoo , Peak Design  , Taylor Stitch , Ritchey Design , Hunt Wheels , IRC Tires , and a few more that will be announced later. We have a TON of products that we will be giving away to people that donate. More on that below.""I'm motivated by the recent tragedies involving George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and the systemic injustice that black men and women face in America, I have been compelled to take action to help expedite the positive change that I would like to see take place in this country."" - Calvin Smith ( @seesmith_ )Our mission is to join together and raise money to help eradicate the systemic injustice black men and women face within the United States of America. One part of this systemic injustice is the ""Digital Divide"" or ""Digital Gap"" in underserved communities. The Digital Divide is simply defined as any gap between those who have access to computers, technology and the Internet and those who do not. One in three, or 14 million, African Americans do not have access to computer technology in their homes. Additionally, 35% percent of black households do not have access to Internet. Digital literacy is also an issue in these communities. How can an individual look for a job, complete online course work satisfactorily if they do not fully understand how to utilize technology?The Hidden Genius Project is one of those organizations. Through their 15-month Immersion and Catalyst programs, they train and mentor black male youth in technology creation, entrepreneurship and leadership skills to transform their lives and communities. Together, we can do our part to help close this digital divide by raising money to donate to this great cause.The donations collected during this fundraiser will go to ""Investing in the Genius Alumni Network "" including the following:–Workforce Developer: Support internships and workforce development opportunities for Geniuses–College Access Sponsor: Support coaching, staff training, and technology costs to serve at least 150 unique Genius alumni, with multiple years of support per GeniusWhat Next?Donate. Then the fun begins. We have sweetened the deal to include a comprehensive raffle of products.  For every $20 you donate you get one entry in the prize drawing.

Since 1978, we have been a landmark in Silver Lake, Los Angeles - a safe, pro-LGBTQ, all-inclusive neighborhood gym.BBG is known as the friendliest gym in L.A. and has been dubbed “the Cheers of Gyms” where members are greeted by their first name. You’re certain to see familiar faces working behind front desk, year after year. For the past 6 months we have been holding onto hope for a future in the same Silver Lake neighborhood that we’ve been rooted in for 42 years. Covid-19 has impacted our family business, like many small businesses, and forced us to face dark times.When Covid-19 halted life as we know it this past March, BBG was hit especially hard; fitness facilities have become a forgotten industry. We are limited by our indoor space and furthermore, have been offered no rent forgiveness or reduction. Given the costs of maintaining a business (rent, business taxes, insurances, utilites, etc.) while being forcibly closed, there is no guarantee when or if BBG will be able to reopen without your help.Over the years, the neighborhood has changed - gone are many of the long standing businesses that once called Silver Lake their home. We have a long history in our community and through the tough times, we’ve remained standing - always finding a way to come back stronger than before thanks to the support of our members. There’s never been a doubt that we could weather whatever life presented to us. So, to all of the past and present members, and to communities both near and far, we say this: The entire BBG Family would be eternally grateful for any support that you can give.We love you. Jackie Joniec and The BBG Family.

It pains me to share, that this is one of those difficult times...One of our fellow Weston Eagles players, David Granger, has lost both parents at the young age of 12. He lost his mother, Carol, to breast cancer after he concluded his 2nd grade year. A few weeks ago, his father, Adam, lost his battle with cancer as well. As if the agony of losing both parents isn’t more than what any child should bear, David’s paternal grandmother, who he had great affection for, passed away one week before his father.Adam and David were always huge baseball fans and they shared a father-son bond through this beloved sport. David is a talented ball player with an exceptional baseball IQ and sincere love for the comradery the sport provides. His smile, upbeat spirit, and personality are contagious. It is unfathomable that he has lost both of his parents and grandmother at such a young age.Before David’s father, passed away, he prepared for his son’s life by asking his best friend’s family if they would care for David - and this amazing family has taken on this incredible responsibility with love and joy.David and his chocolate Labrador Winston moved in with Hudson Houmes who has been his best friend since 2nd grade. David now lives with Hudson, his sister Crosby, and their parents, Ashley and Matt (and their 2 dogs) :)They are in need of any help our Eagles family can provide. They are doing their best to make changes to their home to help David feel welcomed and equally a part of their family. We are humbly asking for monetary donations that will go directly to the Houmes family to help support David during this difficult and transitional time.If your heart leads you to do so, please make a donation to this incredible family. Please reshare his story and his gofundme page so others can contribute if they desire.Thank you in advance for your love, kindness, and generosity. We are one Eagles family and it brings me joy to know we can count on one another during difficult times, especially when one of our Eagles children is going through the most difficult time of their life.

Phase 1: Goal $20K - Re-Open Campaign: Goal Achieved! Thank you everyone who shared our story or contributed financially to our cause. We are humbled by the amount of support that we received. We believe that we have enough funds to reopen on January 4th, 2020.Phase 2: Goal $100K - Stay Open Campaign: Current to March 31st, 2021 - Due to the challenges in the gymnastics industry, over 100 gyms, nationwide, have closed within the past 3 months. These funds will help ensure that Twisters can survive and then thrive during these uncertain times.FACTS ABOUT TWISTERS- WE ARE THE OLDEST RUNNING GYMNASTICS PROGRAM IN THE SOUTH BAY- WE HAVE PROVIDED SPORTS INSTRUCTION TO KIDS FOR 53 YEARS- WE NEED YOUR HELP TO SURVIVE AND THRIVE Dear Twisters' Members, Past Members, and Community,     Since 1967, Twisters Gymnastics, Inc. has provided the Santa Clara County community with youth sports instruction, after school care, and entertainment in a family setting. Throughout its 53 years of existence, Twisters has created a local reputation for providing quality instruction while maintaining a culture that stresses love of sport, a growth mindset, and community.     Unfortunately, after seven months of being unable to operate at a sustainable level, Twisters is at risk of becoming another statistic of the Covid-19 Pandemic. During the first few months, we received a lot of financial support from many of you via Zoom classes and voluntary membership payments. We truly appreciate and will never forget everyone's support during that time. During that time, Twisters also obtained a SBA PPP Loan to stay afloat and to keep key staff members employed. However, this loan will be depleted by the end of October 2020.     Currently, Twisters is in the process of relocating to 2800 Bowers Avenue, Santa Clara, CA 95051. Unfortunately, delays within the Santa Clara City Planning Department due to the pandemic and the costs associated with engineering, architectural, and permitting fees have depleted our reserves. As many of you know, it takes a lot of capital to relocate and Twisters currently owes $7,500 in Architectural Services, $1,500 for City Permitting Fees, and $1,000 for Engineering Services. These are costs that are due before the Tenant Improvement (TI) process. Additionally, we've estimated that the facility set up will cost approximately $7,500 - $10,000. Fortunately, our new landlord has agreed to install an in-the-ground pit and undertake the major tenant improvements for us. The estimated date of completion for these improvements is November 30th, 2020.      Hopefully, at the end of this process, our intention is to reopen on Monday, January 4th, 2021. We also have plans to dissolve Twisters' current S Corporation status and create a ""new"" 501c3 nonprofit organization for Twisters to operate under. It seems to be a more suitable fit for how Twisters operates and is consistent with our community's values. If the Federal Government is unable to provide future relief for struggling businesses through a second stimulus package, then a Phase 2 Campaign will be created in order to stay open while a vaccine is developed and occupancy restrictions are lifted. Currently, a 25% occupancy limit is tough to operate under for any business.  

     On a personal level, our daughter, Remi Fusilero (11), has a dream to compete at the Elite Level and earn a college scholarship. We believe that she has the talent to accomplish both. Our dream is to accompany her throughout this process and to guide her with methods that are based upon the positive aspects of our sport.     If we’re blessed and fortunate to continue this journey, Remi and I will continue to serve our community through our Facebook Page, ""Allan and Remi Fusilero's Gymnastics Drills and Personal Favorites"" by posting our favorite drills, our drills, training methods, and philosophy. We'll also share her progress throughout her career. It'll be quite interesting to see if she achieves her goals and where this journey takes her.     Please help Twisters and our community continue its journey by sharing this request. We're not asking for big donations from a few, but hopefully, small donations from many. I’ve always believed that every successful endeavor is the sum of many small triumphs. We are hopeful that this can be one of those times.     Our ownership of Twisters has been a journey that we've been extremely proud of over the past 15 years and one that I know represents the Gymnastics Community with integrity, passion, and honor. We'd love to see it continue. Thank you for your time and consideration. Go Twisters 2020 and ""hopefully"" beyond.We would love to ""turn the lights back on"". Thanks again everyone.Sincerely,Allan Fusilero, President / OwnerTwisters Gymnastics, Inc. / Proud Father of Remi Fusilero"

This GoFundMe platform will enable members of our club to donate to the fund should they wish to do so, in order to show our support and appreciation for all their hard work over the years.We have extended this fundraiser through Fathers Day and will begin distributing the funds as soon as possible thereafter.  We will work with John, Steve and Anthony to ensure an equitable disbursement (years of experience/full-time versus part-time/had planned to work this summer). Should you have any questions, please reach out to me directly [email redacted]."

He is NOT the kind of person to ask for help with anything!  So, this video is so heartbreaking to watch!! And yet, he did an amazing job relaying all that Revolution has had to endure since shutting down in March. We have athletes and their families calling daily that Justin has to turn away. We can NOT lose his life's work because of this!And now with the latest hit to our industry, we have been excluded from Phase 4 re-opening! After spending so much money to meet and exceed COVID Safety Protocol!We need to HANG ON for our athletes!! They have lost SO much already! Revolution Athletics is their feel-good place to go, mentally and physically. The smile these kids come off the turf with from being with their favorite trainers! Confidence and self esteem they feel daily from their hard work and having the best trainers on Long Island behind them every step of the way.  Just priceless!Like so many of us, the bills are still rolling in! If you could find it in your hearts to help us out and stay alive here so that we can continue to support our athletes with their dreams it would be beyond appreciated and we would ALL be so grateful!Any contributions that we would have left after expenses would be put towards scholarships for underprivileged athletes!Please stay well! We are working hard to get back! Thank you for YOUR support!! Our gratitude is beyond words!

For over 20 years, New Canaan Crew /Maritime Rowing Club introduces hundreds of athlete, boys and girls, to the sport of rowing.  Our mission is to provide a rewarding team experience for high school and middle school students interested in physical challenge, competition, and developing coordination and rowing skills.  We  promote discipline, physical conditioning, personal responsibility, mutual respect and a sense of accomplishment – all important aspects of our kids’ education and preparation for the future.Beginning with just 13 NCHS rowers in 1997,  NCC/MRC now trains over 100 rowers each season from area schools and  has gained national prominence as a leading junior rowing program. Our rowers compete regionally, nationally, and internationally on the U.S. Junior National Team, and have been medal winners at all levels -- holding the National Championship for five consecutive years. In addition, our alumni compete at the highest levels within the sport at college and beyond.As a club sport, New Canaan Crew/Maritime Rowing Club is self-funded and relies on annual fundraisers to purchase  necessary equipment to support the training needs of the program: high quality shells for various sized groups of rowers (ranging from single boats to ones holding up 8 rowers) oars, training ergs, weight equipment. Our equipment costs a great deal of money but makes a tremendous difference to race results in the extremely competitive arena in which NCC/MRC competes.COVID-19 has not only halted our traditional regatta season, it has forced us to cancel our traditional plant and pie fundraisers. However, we continue to persevere in the face of this challenge to not only train ,but also raise funds, so that we will be prepared for the medal podium once the pandemic restrictions are lifted. Won't you join our team as a champion supporter and cheer these kids to victory?"

Our dream was coming true and things were great until Covid-19 has thrown us flat on our back. But like true martial artists, we refuse to stay down. My name is Garry St. Leger and my humble roots began at a small dojo in Brooklyn, led by Parnel Legros (92’ Olympian, Haiti).  We were part of a community dojo in a the cafeteria of Starrett Judo.  Legros’ Program regardless of funds was exceptional.  He created a home for all individuals to learn about martial arts but also become even better people.  I was a beneficiary of his tough love leadership.  I watched countless lives changed for the better. This Influenced me to want to give back in the best way that I know how.  Over the last few months during this pandemic, we’ve done everything we can to keep the school going.  Zoom teachings, outdoor classes, you name it, we did it.  We greatly appreciate the Love and support that kept us afloat during these unprecedented times.   But the students are   ready to step back on the mat.  If you can find it in your hearts to give, we can use the funds to fill our gaps.  We have been bleeding and swimming in operational expenses.  Your kind and generous donations will Help make the transition back on the mats as smooth as possible.  It is quite costly to upgrade our hvac system and we are operating by the skin of our teeth. Like all great things, our dream is worth fighting for.  Will you join me, Garry St Leger, in the fight of our lives to get back on the mat? I know everyone is going through a hard time. If you can donate, that would be great.  But If not, Please Share my message.

I personally feel so lucky that my family has enough to eat each day and I constantly find myself thinking about the millions of people in our country (many of whom are children ) who aren't so lucky.Your donations, of whatever size, will inspire me as I run (slowly) and will immediately help those who are food insecure.  My family will match every donation that is made so your donation will have DOUBLE the impact right off the bat.

Without urgent financial help it will not survive.  Ricky Ricardo, owner and manager of the restaurant and sports bar, has been afflicted with Alzheimer’s Disease which has been progressive for the past 4 years.  His wife Tina has been doing her best to manage the sports bar but the COVID pandemic has kept Ricky’s closed in these recent months.  The cash inflow has stopped but the bills, taxes continue.  Financial help is urgently needed.  This has been the perfect storm of bad luck.  Ricky’s needs help

I am Dr. Robert Gingery.  My Vascular Surgical practice is in San Leandro and over the last 20 years Tina and Ricky have been two of my closest friends.

Ricky’s Sports Bar has been a fixture in the East Bay for nearly half a century.  It has been home base for the Oakland Raider Nation and the main gathering place to watch and share all the pro sporting events in the area and nationally.  Many of us have gathered to watch the Raiders, Golden State Warriors and the A’s over the years.  What great times.

Rick’s has hosted every kind of event: sports, clubs, local government, hospital groups, business meetings and parties.  You name it, they’ve done it.  I took a traffic school course there to avoid have my speeding ticket on my record.

I have seen Ricky and Tina create a classic place with a warm welcoming atmosphere that is unequalled elsewhere.  Ricky’s has more viewable flatscreens per square foot than any other sports bar, I have ever seen. Ricky’s Sports Bar was named one of the top 2 sports bars in the country in Sports illustrated Magazine several years ago.

How can we let it go under?

My plan is to raise enough money via this crowdfund effort to get Ricky’s through this COVID shut down period and perhaps allow them the funds to open outdoor dining until we get there.

Please help.  I know none of us wants to lose Ricky’s, one of the classic,iconic sports bars in the USA.  I know you will help.  Thanks."

I am a first generation Filipino American international educator/trainer, videographer/photographer, former ball player, and surfer. CTW has set a high bar for itself, and I am proud to say that we are getting there. We need your help take the next steps though.WHY ARE WE DOING THIS? — Fighting Stereotypes • Creating BIPOC SpacesAt LA’s first paddle out honoring George Floyd , I realized that the ocean, one of my most prized sanctuaries, is almost entirely a white space. Surfing was invented by BIPOC, but it was then commodified by colonizers, pushing BIPOC inland while tokenizing a select few as “exotic” surfers. This racism creates stereotypes about a relationship with water and the ocean that many BIPOC have internalized as part of their ethnic identity (""oh, we don't swim""). This  obstacle makes ocean play seem too frivolous to invest hard-earned money in. I decided to change this, and so with the help of friends and family, I started Color The Water on social media with the hashtag #colorthewater. We have been able to do a lot in two short months!WHAT WE HAVE DONE SO FAR — Coaching • Media • Surf MeetupsCTW has coached over 30 surfers to date, with over 20 more on the way. This amounts to nearly 125 private/semi-private lessons, each lasting about one to two hours (roughly $30,000 worth of coaching/rentals). Accompanying these lessons, surf coaches from Venice Beach to India have offered over fifty hours of remote and in-person video analysis like this Wave Breakdown. CTW has daily, often twice daily small surf meetups that create a safe, positive, and welcoming space for BIPOC. Our makeshift CTW HQ has helped people access the ocean with even greater ease, and we all hope one day we can have an HQ to call our own.WHY DO WE NEED FUNDS? —  Access • 100% Free Lessons • Sustaining CTW Getting to the beach can be time consuming and expensive. Private surf lessons can cost $150 for 1.5 hours (without media), and gear rental costs around $50. It's just too much for most people. For BIPOC, those barriers have compounded due to generations of systemic racism. That is why I am passionate about making our lessons 100% free for hopeful learners. CTW has grown such that we need help to keep the community moving forward.Money raised through this GoFundMe will go towards the following categories: (1) Essential CTW HQ Surf Equipment (boards, +size suits, tents, etc)(2) Surf Media Equipment (camera, lenses, action camera, water-housing)(3) Surf Teacher & Videographer Compensation (4) CTW HQ (surf, beach equipment, HQ rent)(5) CTW Surfer Kit (essential gear for progression)For full budget documentation, including community contributions and stretch-goals, click here .Here are some of the things our surfers have had to share about what #colorthewater means to them.“CTW has helped me get over the hump by taking my skill set from beginner to intermediate.  David has a skill for seeing what I was doing wrong and articulating how to make those correction on the fly.  I’m happy to be a part of the CTW community.”- Nate""Color the Water has become the sacred, safe haven I always knew I needed but didn’t have access to until now. I finally feel like I belong in the ocean, and this community has made me feel so welcomed.""- Ludine""The CTW surfing community feels like a second family.""- Rahzizi""CTW set us up with gear and made possible what felt impossible. David was crystal clear with his explanations, and great at quickly preparing beginners at varying skill levels. I’ll always remember the serenity of finally making it out on the water — the setting sun painting the water orange and pink. Thank you, CTW!""- Cruz and Lila""I met David when I was struggling to keep up with more WAY more Advanced surfers than I. He asked if he could help me and I couldn’t say “ YES!” Fast enough. As a black woman who is new to surfing it can be very discouraging to go out on your own to learn esp when No one looks like you in the water. CTW offers all people of color a safe , friendly and comfortable environment to learn and grow as a surfer within the most  diverse surf community I’ve ever seen. I’ve improved in so many areas but most notably in my confidence . Definitely one of the best things to happen to me since moving to LA. ""- Erin“In the sea, each wave washes away all my troubles as I float and the calm comes over me. The ocean is my therapy. When I see diversity in the water, it fuels my soul to get better and better. On land I am biracial but the sea is all of me.""- Noemie“Surfing taught me how to surrender. Color the Water creates a space for me to feel safe to do so.” - Joi K. Madison ""Color the Water is not only a movement that acknowledges systemic racism by providing equity in the water for BIPOC, but provides sanctuary to cope with community trauma during this time.""- Faith""I have no doubt you are making huge waves with Color the Water because it has been a long time coming.""- Nana, mother of Noemie, CTW Surfer""If the ocean is truly for everyone, than it's about time we open these gates for those who have not been privileged in a way that makes surfing a genuine choice, and not just an unfulfilled fantasy. Please help us break down as many barriers of entry as we can, so that BIPOC can connect back to their ancient ancestors and shift surfing from a stoic, mostly white multi-billion dollar industry  to a shared celebration of the beauty and magic of the ocean we've been far too long kept from. Not anymore though, now it's time for us to color the water.""- David"

There are countless examples of staff members and families that selflessly committed themselves to the success and well-being of our programs and athletes.In order to make a difference, we rely on the support of generous individuals and businesses in our community. At this time, we have suspended all public fundraisers for this year due to the pandemic. As you know the Spring 2020 Season was cancelled and the Club took a big financial hit. Our Scholarship Fund is depleted and the cost for the Lights at Down's Family Park are a big burden. Our goal is to raise enough money to BUY lights instead of renting the lights for the soccer fields at Downs Family Park. The cost of buying this is approximately $50,000 and it will save us $10-$12,000 per year.In addition - Southampton Town United provides scholarships for the club fees for children whose families struggle financially. This year we have awarded more scholarships than ever before and simply put we are running low on funds and need to raise money to be able to continue to provide this for those families in need going forward. We are looking to raise $30,000 for our scholarship fund. Southampton Town United Soccer Club, is a registered 501(c)3.  Your donation is 100% tax deductible and 100% of the donations go to funding lights and the scholarship fund.

In these uncertain times, we are especially grateful to have dedicated individuals like you in our Southampton Town United Soccer Club Family.Also - if you have any great fund raising ideas or able to help we would love to hear from you.Lastly - we are also now starting to look at a Title Sponsor for the Club and something we want to have in place for the Fall 2021 Season.

We understand and relish our position as mentors, role models and friends to your children. It’s bigger than basketball! With that being said, we have stumbled upon the opportunity of a lifetime. Our own state of the art warehouse training facility! This space is truly a dream come true and we intend to make this facility our home base for what we do best; teaching life lessons through the game of basketball! We have purposefully chosen the warehouse size to ensure that our lease, taxes, and utilities are appropriate for our revenue model. 

We need your help. We’re asking for any amount of donation to help this all come together. Your generous donations will go towards a maple wood sport court, 3 breakaway baskets, a shooting gun, resistance bands, basketballs, etc. We’ve been very lucky to have a Senior Healthcare Executive at Cigna donate over $15k to help us get started. Every penny counts, so thank you in advance for your contributions! Our use of funds will be approximately $15-20k for buildout and $10k in reserve for lease expenses. No funds will be used for our own personal benefit.

All students and teachers will directly benefit from the proceeds from this fun-filled and community-building fundraiser. WHY SHOULD MY FAMILY PARTICIPATE IN THE 2020 WALK-A-THON?1. Over the years, Walk-a-Thon earnings have aided in the purchase of numerous educational items, equipment and activities that would not have been available to our students without the funds raised from this event.  Most recently chrome books have been purchased for students as well as items for sanitization and individual classroom needs.  2. The Walk-a-Thon is a unique opportunity for our students to actively participate in raising money for our school. The planned activities will encourage our students to be part of the SPB team and work together to achieve a common goal.  This year especially we want to give our kids something to look forward to as they have in the past.  We also want to encourage families to be actively involved.  We are part of the Saint Paschal Baylon community and now more than ever we need to come together to support the school, the teachers and our children!2020 EARNINGS GOALS: The earnings from the 2020 Walk-a-Thon, will continue to further our technology initiative by providing materials needed for the STREAM model of education. STREAM takes STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) and incorporates the areas of Religion and the Arts. Technology allows our teachers to provide diverse methods of instruction and engages and prepares our students for the future. In previous years, the PTO has helped to fund the purchase of one-to-one technology, such as Chromebooks and iPad carts. We appreciate your assistance in helping us to attain our goals and support our teachers and students!Saint Paschal Baylon Catholic School was selected, the NINTH straight year, as one of the recipients of the 2019-2020 Governor’s Thomas Edison Award for Excellence in STEM Education and Student Research.  SPB was one of only 37 schools in the state of Ohio selected to receive this award.  We are honoured that the Ohio Academy of Science has recognized our school and teachers who have not only provided a strong STEM curriculum, but who have also encouraged participation in many other activities to stimulate student interest in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.  Michael Woytek, Executive Director of The Ohio Academy of Science wrote, “Clearly, your school is committed to teaching beyond the boundaries of the traditional classroom and pushing the limits of experiential learning.  Scientific research and technological design can only be learned by doing.  Thank you for nurturing Ohio’s next generation of STEM talent by helping them develop critical skills like problem-solving, teamwork, collaboration, and communications.”

In addition to being an outstanding and dedicated wrestler, Johnny loved being a part of the wrestling program and made many lasting friendships because of it. Both his parents, John Rynn, Jr. and Amy Greer are also alumni of OMHS.At the end of each academic year, the wrestling coaching staff will choose the wrestler they feel showcases the same passion and dedication as Johnny. The award will be paid directly to cover wrestling camp  fees for said wrestler where hopefully   they can enhance their skills and create bonds that they will cherish as Johnny did. Donations are very much appreciated so the family can continue to honor Johnny and his memory in a way we know would make him happy.Thank you,The Rynn Family

Instead of posting an update I am re-writing why this gofundme exists. I’ve learned 2 lessons this past week when this was started. 1) the lacrosse community is much more receptive to a donation page if there is social media entertainment surrounding it and 2) that same social media entertainment can get out of hand as the PLL expands beyond the lacrosse community. What started out as chirping in twitter I believe has been escalated and it is now time to distance ourselves from that. 

My favorite thing in the world is coaching, especially in areas that don’t have an abundance of college/PLL resources in their backyard. My main message while coaching is that you want to be the best lacrosse player possible, but you never want that to define who you are as a person. When I tell athletes that I hope it resonates, and I spend a significant amount of time thinking of ways to articulate it so that it resonates with them. The characteristics that define you should be much deeper than anything you can accomplish on a lacrosse field. Empathetic. Kind. Caring. Funny. Whatever it may be. What I can’t do, is talk about that while not being a role model myself. This campaign to raise money has nothing to do with social media, on field, or real life rivalries. It has to do with the lacrosse world helping out those that need it. The high risk children in Chicago largely have no idea what lacrosse is or how incredible it can be within their own community. When I visit them i refuse to be the “social media beef” guy. That’s low hanging fruit. Instead, I’d like to talk about what happens if you immerse yourself into the sport of lacrosse and how many lifelong friends/opportunities a game can give you. 

That’s the end of my rant and I’ll stop talking about myself now because ITS FOR THE KIDS

This is obviously a devastating decision we had absolutely no say in. We are a proud program with a rich history in not only Atlantic 10 baseball but Big 5 baseball as well. Outside of that, as we all know, baseball goes beyond the Diamond. The impact playing this game at the division one level can't be put into words. You grow not only as an athlete but as a person every single day you push through the grueling work outs, practices, team meetings, and study halls. Nobody else on campus works as hard as a college athlete but it's something we all take pride in. We are now asking for anyone with the means to help to donate to our cause to help save our program. We owe it to the one's who still have an opportunity to play this great game to not give up, because that's what we were each instilled with while at LaSalle.

Since this season was pretty much cancelled, our operating costs did not stop and are piling up quickly draining our reserves. 

We were unable to open our famous snack bar which brings in approx 75% of our income. We were also unable to hold other planned fundraisers to further support us. 

We are scrambling to come up with solutions to keep us open for next season, however, we desperately need your help. We have already reduced many utilities, but maintenance costs and  property taxes/rent continue to rise. Unlike other leagues, we do not own our fields, we lease them from our HOA. This is how we’re able to keep registration prices low. 

PLEASE help save SLz Little League. We have been here since 1958 (62 years ago), serving the community, teaching young minds, building friendships and making memories. We are ran solely by volunteers, donations from our proud sponsors, player registrations and fund raising. We are also the only league in the area to have Challenger Division. You’ve probably driven by and seen our President Gary Allen out there working tirelessly on a daily basis, from 4am until dusk.  How many of you all played here or came to watch a game here?

This year, Poway High’s cheer program consists of 47 exceptional athletes who have been hard at practice, (safely), gearing up for the year ahead.As with many others, our program was unable to participate in most of our normal activities this summer, such as summer camp, uniform fittings, and our annual youth clinics, which happen to be our biggest fundraiser, bringing in the bulk of our program funds. Poway High Cheer is 100% self funded by donations and fundraiser. This year, through our fundraising efforts, we hope to continue to contribute to a number of different costs crucial to the success of our program, including, facility rentals on and off campus, equipment upgrades, team events, and uniform/practice wear costs. This is where we are asking for your help!Our PHS cheerleaders are working to reach two team goals:·         Upon reaching their 1st goal of $11,000, the team will be purchasing sweats to keep them cozy when the season ,(hopefully) starts this winter!·         Upon reaching their 2nd goal of $14,000 the team will be provided the coveted Adidas team slides to help lessen the wear on their cheer shoes to and from games/practice!Each cheerleader is hoping to reach their minimum personal goal of $250 dollars!  Can you help us?

From there we moved into a closet-sized space on Carroll Street below 4th Avenue when no one ventured that way for fitness and my amazing strong community got even stronger.

Hello everyone I hope you, your family, and friends are staying healthy during this pandemic.As you know, the pandemic has affected many non-profit profit organizations, like ours. We represent Las Lomas Recreational Association, better known as “Las Lomas Potros Baseball Club”.This association was created in 1955 to form organized baseball in a small low-middle class neighborhood in San Juan Puerto.  Since then our program and facilities have had minor transformations with some state and private donations.Since the passage of Hurricane Maria in 2017, our facilities endure substantial damage, specifically, the lighting system. After that life-changing event, we haven’t been able to use thefacility at night or late in the afternoon. We waited patiently to see if funds were available to replace or fix the current situation. But up to this point have not received any help from any State or Federal Agency. To make matters worst, the Pandemia and lockdown have created a hardship on our overall facilities and most important the finances of the Association. Since March of 2020, when the lockdown was enforced we haven’t been able to collect any ofthe dues required to the players nor have we been able to secure any help from the private sector.  Our Club and Facilities were the most suitable for youth baseball in San Juan and many other cities of Puerto Rico. In addition, our program is the most successful Youth Baseball Program since 1955. We are in a crossroads and we need your help to keep our facilities and program afloat. We need to fix or better replace the existing lighting system and get our facilities back in shape. In addition, there are other administrative expenses that need to be taken care of, such as insurance and               materials. It is very important to mention that no one on the board of the Association has ever benefited economically form keeping this Association and Program running. Our philosophy is to develop great citizens while teaching leadership and social skills fromthe sport of baseball. Since 1955 this organization has won more than 50 championships across Puerto Rico and the United States. In addition, many MLB former and current players have been part of our program. Here is a list of some of the MLB players that have played for Las Lomas:Jorge Posada ( New York Yankees Icon )Eduardo Perez ( Played for several MLB teams and now a baseball analyst for ESPN ) Cristian Vazquez ( Boston Red Sox catcher)Jose Berrios ( Minnesota Twins Pitcher )Kike Hernadez ( LA Dodgers infielder)Joe Jimenez ( Detroit Tigers closer )Jose Morales ( Former Cubs and Rockies catcher) Andy Gonzalez ( Former White Sox infielder and Minor league manager )Tomas Nido ( NY Mets catcher )Jesus "" Motora"" Feliciano ( Former Mets player and active Angels coach )Michael Perez  (Tampa Bay catcher) Luis Atilano ( Former National's pitcher)Rey Navarrete ( Miami Marlins catcher)Alex Rios ( former Blue Jays, White Sox, and Rangers outfield)Giovanni Soto (former Cubs catcher)Plus other baseball greats like Dickie Thon, Ivan de Jesus, and Juan Nieves.Others had the chance to play College Baseball and Minor League Baseball. But more importantly, we have impacted thousands of young men and women to become better persons and contributors to society.We need your help to get our facilities ready in order to continue our mission of developing better human beings and athletes. You can also help by donating equipment for the maintenance field like tractors and machinery etc. Please contact us if you have any questions!!

The Martial Way Kung-Fu Training Center was founded in 1999 and has been servicing the Co-op City community in Bronx, NY, as well as neighboring communities, for the past 20 years.  Our programs include but are not limited to martial arts instruction for children and adults, fitness and wellness classes for adults, an after school program and a fun-filled summer camp.  All of our programs are tailored around character building as well as physical fitness and wellness.  It has been an amazing experience servicing our community and watching [literally] generations of children grow into adulthood.  As we celebrate our milestone 20 year anniversary this year, we were hopeful to continue the momentum from last year by expanding our programs as well as finishing the much needed cosmetic upgrades to our school.  

Unfortunately, this year has now become a year of uncertainty with the surge of this unprecedented pandemic that has literally touched the lives of every person in the world.  New York has been exceptionally impacted and as a result, our school is being horrifically financially impacted by the executive orders to close all non-essential businesses.  It is with great humility that I ask for financial assistance from anyone that is able to donate.  

What steps have been taken since closing in late March?
Immediately following the executive order to close, the immediate move of all kung-fu and fitness classes to an online virtual platform was made.  This task was much more cumbersome than originally thought and  took several weeks to work out the nuances of moving martial arts and fitness to an online platform.  Though we have a handful of students that are continuing their training online, overall, we have lost 85% of our memberships across the board from all of our programs.  During the school year, our after school program and kung-fu program are the two main sources of income.  With the after school program totally closed and memberships radically down, it has been difficult to meet our financial responsibilities.  

What about government aid?
The moment state and federal aid was available, I gathered all of the necessary documents to illustrate how our school was adversely impacted by Covid-19.  As you may know, the first round of federal aid was exhausted in one week due to publicly traded corporations draining millions upon millions of dollars from the fund.  Small businesses that truly need the aid had no chance.  Though there is a second round of aid that is currently available, we still have not received any money to assist us.  The state has also been very slow in their response to our request for aid.  We have applied for a number of grants and loans and are still awaiting responses.  It is important to note that there is no guarantee an approval of any of these pending applications.  

Unfortunately, there has been no communication from our landlord regarding any assistance of deferral they would be looking to provide towards rent and utilities for business in the community that have been mandated to close due to this pandemic.  At best, we will not be charged late fees.  The monthly carrying charges for our school is $4900 per month which includes all utilities, additional commercial leasing fees, and taxes.  As we go into our second month of closure, I continue to monitor this crisis daily.  Though there is no timeline as to when we will be able to open, I know for certain it will not be in the month of May.  The summer months (July & August) are usually our strongest financially due primarily to our summer camp program.  With summer camp also now in jeopardy pending social distancing and state mandates, makes it that much more critical we are able to meet our monthly obligations.  

In summation, we are all in an extremely challenging time.  My personal goal is to ensure this crisis is not the end of our school that has been so very instrumental in the part of thousands of kids' lives that have passed through our doors over the past 20 years.  This virus will pass in time.  My goal to still be able to offer the very essential services and programs for our community when it does.  All donations will be used towards our monthly rent.  

For more information on our school and programs, please visit us at www.martialwaykungfu.net.  
Thank you in advance for your generosity and support.  


Sincerely,

Christopher Robinson
Owner

Whether an athlete trains in the gym's recreational classes, on a competitive gymnastics team, or even on their Elite Acrobatic Team; Realis gives them the tools they need to succeed by offering a safe, nurturing, and competitive environment that many of their athlete's call their second home. RELIEF NEEDED:Unfortunately like most small businesses, the pandemic of Covid-19 forced Realis to close for over 3 months as mandated by the governor of California. During this closure income was halted and training ceased, while expenses continued to add up. Now with the ability to partially reopen many required health and safety procedures are required to be implemented only further increasing the deficit.  In addition, enrollment numbers upon reopening have plummeted. Without the ability to increase enrollments the financial strain on the business is astronomical, and soon, many of the hopes and dreams of the athletes will be cut short.ACHIEVEMENTS: Through Realis' programs athletes have accomplished so much. Whether it's winning World Championships, placing 3rd on America's Got Talent, winning Regional and State Titles, attending colleges with full scholarships or even beginning careers in Cirque Du Soleil. The sky really is the limit! Please consider donating to help keep Realis Gymnastics Academy open and by doing so, continuing to allow their athletes to shoot for the stars and make the future a better place.Thank you

The good news is that they will enjoy Tanzania and Rwanda next year. The bad news is that our guides have lost income from one of the most important three-month blocks of the year.As a company, we advanced our guides three months of salary to help them cope with the economic effects of the pandemic. The salary advance takes them through the end of this month (June). We have laid-off our US staff to help preserve the business. Since Tanzania does not have the social safety net of unemployment insurance, the staff is wholly dependent upon our support to cushion the blow of this major economic disruption.This is where YOU come in. As a past traveler with Access 2 Tanzania and/or Treks 2 Rwanda, we are asking you to lend your support so that we can provide additional support to our team.We know you may want to earmark a gift to your specific guide, but we intend to collect these funds and disburse them evenly so that every single team member and their family is equally supported through this crisis.GoFundMe provides a great platform for cash gifts. But we are also contributing every in-stock item in our online store  to the fundraiser. To make the items last longer and raise more money, we have increased the prices, but at least you will be able to get a t-shirt, sweatshirt, hat, etc... in exchange for your contribution. You can do so knowing every dollar spent will go towards this relief fund as well. Buying an item is also a great way to promote your past trip and encourage friends to consider East Africa for a future adventure. Even if people are not ready to travel just yet, they can begin dreaming and planning for the future.On behalf of the entire Access 2 Tanzania and Treks 2 Rwanda team, thank you for you kind support during this time.If you have questions or concerns, please reach out to us.Asante sana,Brian Singer & Karen StupicOwners

Hiking, skiing, boating, biking - she loves it all, especially when adventuring with her family. This year, McKinley has learned how to operate a power wheelchair, and it has opened up a world of independence and exploration. It is clear that she wants to wander the beaches, charge through hiking trails, and frolic in the snow. We want to give McKinley the ability and freedom to all of that, and much more. We welcome you to help us give McKinley the gift of adventuring. This fundraiser is to provide McKinley with an Extreme X8 4x4 wheelchair. This device will allow her to drive up and down the hills and trails of Western Massachusetts, to roll over the sands of Cape Cod, and everything in between. The chair will cost $16,000 and will last her for many years and countless adventures while allowing her to keep up with her friends and family, even as she grows too big for her family to get her there with their own power. For those who may not know McKinley, she is a passionate and loving 8-year-old girl who will not let her cerebral palsy slow her down or keep her out of the adventures that are waiting for her. Her greatest joys are playing with her family and friends, and that means getting outside to bike, ski, boat, and hike. She has recently moved into a power chair, and it is clear that her ability to drive will propel her to pursue her curiosities, and to give her the independence to move through her world the way all kids should be able to. As a family, we are committed to providing McKinley with the access and freedom to explore and be as independent as possible, and to creating a home and lifestyle around her that enables her to make use of her tools. We believe that this X8 chair will let McKinley explore beaches, woods, mountains, mud, snow, and sand, for years to come, and we are so excited to let her roam!Thank you for considering being a part of McKinley's adventures!

They have been overwhelmed with gratitude and are most thankful for being surrounded with your prayers. They are most certainly being felt during this season.From Corey:Friday, we learned that Brittany's cancer has returned. It has not only returned in the areas that have been affected before but also in new areas. It seems that the immunotherapy that she was on had a rare effect, called hyper-progression, and caused her cancer to multiply rapidly. Brittany's doctor informed us that there is not a known cure for Brittany.The doctor did suggest that Brittany could begin a new round of chemotherapy. They have seen good results with these chemos after hyper-progression. The goal would be to slow the growth of her cancer and give Brittany relief from the swelling and pain in her neck. As soon as Brittany's doctor shared the news, Brittany let us know that she is realistic and understands where things are but that she continues trusting in God and asking for a miracle of healing. Our family will continue trusting God. Brittany and I remind each other and our kids to live each day with eternity in mind. We are practicing to live each day in God's Kingdom by following Jesus. We know that this life is very temporary. Friday's news has been the hardest for us to hear and now share with you. Thank you for the love you have shown to our family over this last year. We have been continually overwhelmed with gratitude for your gifts, food, time, texts, emails, and encouragement. Please continue to pray with us, asking God for Brittany to be healed. That would be wonderful. But no matter what, continue to trust God with us, knowing that he has an eternal plan. He will make all things right in the end. For this, we are the most grateful. We love you,Brittany, Corey, Hannah, Josiah, Lily, and Eben

The costs involved in making glass are extremely high, so we ask that you donate to the project to help this successful event continue. Due to the current Corona Virus situation, myself and The Block Island Tourism Council believe that the Glass Float Project is a very important activity for the island this year due to the fact that this takes outside, and provides a fun healthy activity for those people who are visiting the island and also for Island residents.   Thank you everyone and best of luck finding an orb this season! ~ Eben Horton

Since then I've made the most out of life, graduating from college, getting married, becoming a high school teacher, and now raising two kids.I've been on many amazing trips, seen very cool things, I mean really pushed my boundaries, and A LOT of these adventures has been far away from hard, flat, wheelchair friendly surfaces.Enter: My 4x4 off road wheelchair.15 years ago I crown funded the purchase of my X4. That was when my most efficient means of communication was sending letters through the mail to my parents Christmas card list.! Thanks to the generosity of caring friends and family, wouldn't you know, it worked.I have a hard time overstaying the importance of that chair.It's allowed me to do things like have a pasture, have a garden, and just play in the snow with my kids.     Well sad news... The X4 has seen better days. Trust me, I've put countless hours into troubleshooting error codes, chasing down wiring issues, and getting pushed or towed back home. The motors and gearboxes were there last things to go, so the X4 is currently in pieces, being repaired, and parts are getting expensive and hard to find. So it seams like a good time, to put the X4 on the shelf and get a new,  reliable, more efficient all terrain chair.Enter: The X8.    It's the newest 4x4 all-terrain wheelchair made by Magic Mobility. Same basic setup as mine, just improved chassis, motors, batteries, and electronics.With a price tag of $13,000, it's not something I can afford without your help, and having a reliable all-terrain wheelchair enables me to do so much more than I could with just my manual chair.Full transparency, the purchase price varies from dealer to dealer and is between $13,000 and $17,000. From what I can gather, it's completely up to the dealer how much money they are wanting to make. So if I end up raising more than my goal, I'll be putting the money towards a trailer, for even more access to the things I love to do.With your help, I'll be able to get back to doing the things I love, like working in the garden, hanging by the river with friends, and adventuring with my family. Help me get back off road. Help me get off the beaten path and onto the road less traveled.I promise to keep you up to date on my latest and greatest adventures. And I hope your having adventures of your own.Thanks for taking the time to support me and my family.

Chers amis voyageurs,Suite à la fermeture des frontières du Népal en Mars 2020 due au COVID-19, les guides, cuisiniers et porteurs saisonniers de GST n’ont pu bénéficier de la saison touristique du printemps qui leur permet de vivre six mois de l’année. Nous leur avons conseillé de rentrer au village, le coût de la vie a Kathmandu étant en effet trop élevé.  Malheureusement certains d’entre eux n’ont pas de terres au village ni de maison. Nous ne savons pas si les voyages reprendront cet automne 2020.Comme vous vous en doutez les salariés népalais, saisonniers ou pas, ne bénéficient d’aucune aide gouvernementale ni bien sûr les entreprises. Si cet automne la saison touristique ne reprend pas ou reste faible la situation pour les saisonniers sera très difficile.Nous avons fait une enquête par téléphone pour comprendre quels saisonniers étaient le plus dans le besoin. Il semblerait que sur les 26, 18 ont besoin d’aide urgente. Notre agence ayant épuisé ses fonds lors du séisme de 2015 nous ne pouvons qu’offrir une somme insuffisante à chacun des saisonniers.  Nous continuons à donner un salaire équivalent à un mi-temps à notre équipe du bureau bien que l'agence soit fermée depuis mi-mars.Les guides Kancha et Jaman s'occupent de leurs champs aux villages, Jambu a trouvé du travail comme menuisier mais Lakpa , Somé, Pemba et Basanta ne possèdent ni champs ni maison à leur village et sont obligés de rester à Kathmandu.Certains, comme Dawa, avaient une activité hors saison de vendeur dans un magasin de Thamel ou comme Gyan, cuisinier dans des mariages. Ils ont aussi perdu cette seconde activité. Les magasins de Thamel étant fermés et les mariages interdits sauf en très petit comité.Les guides et assistants guides bloqués à Kathmandu ont de grandes difficultés à payer leur loyer.Nous espérons votre aide pour les équipes qui vous ont fait découvrir et aimer le Népal grâce à leur sourire et leur soutien pour passer les cols et les ponts vertigineux. Même une petite somme pourra aider leurs familles en attendant que les trekkers soient de retour au Népal. Nous vous en sommes très reconnaissants.L’Equipe de GSTUn ami proche, Shirish Dali accepte de recevoir l’argent sur sont compte et nous le remettre. GoFundMe n accepte que des comptes dans certains pays, le Népal n en fait pas parti. Dear Friends, Following the COVID-19 lockdown in March 2020 our freelance guides, cooks and porters were not able to benefit from the Spring’s season which provides an income that allows them to live for 6 months. We advised them to return to their villages a few days before the lockdown. But a large number do not have homes nor lands to cultivate in their villages.

We do not know if travelers will come to Nepal this autumn.

As you probably already know , Nepali freelancers and employers do not benefit of any help from the government and neither do businesses. If there are no trekkers this autumn or only a small amount,  the living situation of freelancers is going to be difficult.We led an investigation to find out who was most in need for support. Of the 26 freelancers  18 are inneed of urgent  of help.

Our trekking agency used all its funds following the 2015 earthquake that struck Nepal. The little weare  giving will be an insufficient amount for all. We have continued giving a part time salary to the office staff of GST since the beginning of lockdown.  Jaman and Kancha have returned to their village homes and have land that they have cultivated. Jambu Sherpa has found work as a carpenter. But Lakpa , Somé, Ngawang, Pemba and Basanta do not have a village home to go back to nor land to farm, they are obliged to stay in Kathmandu.

Some like Dawa worked during off seasons in souvenir shops in Thamel, or like Gyan, a cook in wedding venues. Both have lost this secondary job as well. Shops in Thamel having closed down and weddings having been cancelled ( they are only permitted at home in groups of less than 15 people) .

The guides, assistant guides and cooks stuck in Kathmandu are having a very hard time to pay their rent.

We are hoping for your help to those who made you discover and appreciate Nepal thanks to their smiles and support to walk across high mountain passes and those famous suspension bridges ! Even a small amount will be of help for them and their families until trekkers come back to Nepal.

A close friend , Shirish Dali has accepted to receive the money Om his account as GoFundMe does not work with Nepali accounts. He will be forwarding us the money from his personal account and we shall distribute to all guides and freelance staff .

We are grateful to you , GST Team

Our daily lives have been upended, tourism - our means and our passion - suspended. As we've been required to put distance between ourselves and those we care for, Classic Africa Safaris is pausing to consider what this all means to us and how we evolve and move forward. In the meantime, we've put our heads together and come up with a way to tackle an urgent need in the Uganda tourism community that involves most of our travelers - the Porters Association of Bwindi Impenetrable National Park. While most porters are subsistence farmers, the bulk of their income comes from assisting visitors as they track the mountain gorillas of Bwindi Impenetrable Forest. The salary and tips they receive help them feed their families, send their children to school and even save for a larger plot of land or to open a small shop. Without tourists, they have no income stream and as the porters are a separate association not affiliated with the UWA, they are not receiving support or salaries during this time. The situation is becoming dire and many of the porters and their families are very hungry.Classic Africa Safaris is preparing to make a significant food delivery to the porters association once the lock down in Uganda is lifted and we can drive a vehicle to Bwindi. We'd like to ask our trade partners and their past and current travelers around the world to consider assisting us in these efforts. CAS is donating the vehicle, fuel, driver salary and stipend for the multi-day trip to Bwindi and back. We're asking you to come to the table and assist with donations for staples - beans, rice, maize-meal (posho), sugar, cooking oil and bars of hand soap. Our goal is to raise US$5,000. Some of our CAS team have donated personally and past travelers are contributing, as well.  As Uganda is still in lock down, we don't know exactly when we will be able to take a vehicle and the food supplies to Bwindi, but we will keep you updated on this process with details, numbers and photos.CAS is not an NGO, nor do we have a non-profit arm, so these donations will not be tax deductible. We hope that you will support in whatever way you can based on our long-standing relationship and our responsibility to the communities in which we all operate and make our living. If your company, past (or future) travelers to Uganda or staff members are interested in making a contribution of any size please use this Go Fund Me page or contact us  for more details. Thank you for your support and partnership over the years and we are eagerly looking forward, beyond COVID, and are waiting for the days that we can celebrate our successes together (in person!), again. Stay well and take care,Phil Ward, Mel Gormley, Lyndsay Harshman, Hilda Komugisha, Cissy Nantume & the entire CAS team

The coronavirus pandemic has caused a global health crisis and an economic downturn. The Tanzanian tourism industry and Peak Planet has been significantly impacted. Our business has ground to a halt. While some clients still have their climbs scheduled for this season, many have postponed their trips for 2021. As a result, most of our staff will have little to no income during the summer and maybe longer.  Unlike some countries, where governments have stepped into support their citizens, Tanzania offers no such assistance.It is with great humility that we come to you, our former clients, to ask that you consider helping our staff through this difficult time. We hope that with your support, we can offer our crews some funding so they can pay for basic needs while they wait for tourists to return.Peak Planet employs approximately 200 full time porters, cooks and guides. We hope to pay each crew member $50. It may not sound like much, but $50 is enough for each person to feed and sustain him- or herself and their extended family for one month. Our crews are not looking for a hand out; they are more than happy to work for payment. So in return, we will sponsor a multi-day clean-up project on Mount Kilimanjaro. This initiative aligns with one of our core principles - to promote environmentally responsible enjoyment of the outdoors.  Our staff will remove trash and human waste around the park to keep the mountain pristine and beautiful for all future visitors.Please consider donating to our guides, cooks and porters. We are collecting donations through this GoFundMe campaign. Our goal is to raise $10,000. The campaign funds will be audited by the Kilimanjaro Porters Assistance Project (KPAP), a non-profit organization committed to improving the working conditions of porters on Kilimanjaro. Therefore, you can be assured that your donations will be delivered directly into the hands of the mountain staff.We greatly appreciate any amount you may be able offer. Remember that even small donations will go a long way for each person and their families.Sincerely,Peak Planet

My staff of 25 Porters and 10 Guides and their families have been deeply affected by this devastating shutdown.  They have lost their only income and our government does not provide assistance for them or their families during these unusual times. Guides and Porters, are the true heroes of your adventure in Nepal. Most Trekkers will hire guides and porters to carry their supplies in the high altitude. They work tirelessly to make sure you have a safe and enjoyable trip, and they are eager to share their love and knowledge of Nepal. You leave Nepal with new friendships that will last a lifetime.  With our country closed to the 100,000 visitors that explore the beauty of the mighty Himalayas every year, our guides and porters, as well as their families, are in trouble. They are more often than not the sole provider for their families, and as mentioned previously, with no assistance from our government they are suffering great financial hardship. I am reaching out to you with the hope that you will help me raise funds for my team of Guides and Porters.  I never imagined we would be facing these difficult times, and I fear the uncertainty of our future.  I am seeking your kindheartedness to give a lending hand. No donation is too small and will go a long way to bring a smile back to their faces.   I know together we can bring joy back to those who are suffering great hardships during these unprecedented times. If you are reading this,  please know that any help you choose to give, whether it be a monetary donation, or simply sharing this campaign on social media, will be appreciated beyond measure.  At the end of this campaign the funds will be divided evenly among my team of 10 Guides and 25 Porters with the hopes of easing the financial strain each one of them and their families is  suffering as a result of our country being closed to all international travelers. I look forward to the day I can welcome each and everyone of you with open arms to my beautiful country of Nepal.  Please stay safe and take care of each other. With sincerest gratitudeSali

I am Alethia Hinds and I live in Miami, FL. I climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro in December 2019. It was definitely one of the hardest things I’ve ever done as I’m sure many of you will agree. I wouldn’t have made it to Uhuru Peak without the support and care of my Climb Kili Team along the way. My team anticipated all of my needs, guided me through difficult paths, and believed in me more than I believed in myself!From all of the amazing reviews I’ve read and my personal account, I know I am not the only one that received exceptional care with Climb Kili!Unfortunately, due to COVID-19, there has been an unexpected halt in their hiking season. The guides and porters who helped us up the mountain are now in need of financial support as their means of income has been eliminated.It’s our turn to take the lead.It has become increasingly more clear that COVID-19 will have a lasting impact on the travel and tourism industry.  If you are able to, I am asking you to participate in a campaign to create a food pantry for the Climb Kili staff in Tanzania.  This way, they can be supplied with the staples they need most. Even a $10 USD donation will go a long way to support the life of our friends in Tanzania. To put this in perspective $10 USD can purchase ALL of the following:1 kg (2.2 lbs) Rice1 kg (2.2 lbs) Maize flour1 kg (2.2 lbs) Dried beans4 loaves of Bread2.3 kg (5 lbs) of PotatoesAll of the money raised on this platform will go directly to the fund to purchase the aforementioned items and they will be safely and equally distributed to the staff in Tanzania.With the support we receive from these contributions we do a small part to ensure our friends can sustain for a little longer, hopefully until tourism and travel begin again.Your support will mean the world.Thank you, thank you, thank you!

My name is Justin Edminster. I am the partner of Nayomi Kanz, daughter of Namaste Kanz. Namaste is a cancer survivor. She began her fight with cancer in 2014 when doctors removed a cancerous tumor in her breast. The battle was thought to be won; unfortunately, the cancer returned, and this time, it has occupied in and around Namaste's lungs. Both women reside near and dear to my heart. 

 

Recently, King 5 News and Drew Mikkelsen did a story about Namaste's fight, and captured just a sliver of the powerful love shared between mother and daughter. The creation of this campaign was inspired by people I love and the opportunity presented by King 5 News. Unprompted, my stepmother texted me, ""Son, why didn't you tell us about Nayomi and her mom on the news??!"" She sent me a phone recording of the news segment via text. It brought tears to my eyes, and it gave rise to the opportunity in front of me. 

 

Nayomi has recently floated the idea — floated.. haha — that her mom has wanted to rent or buy a motor home for their annual summer trip to the coast. I thought, what better way to continue Namaste's story than by getting her there in style. Let's blow this balloon up a little bigger and let it travel a little higher. So, I ask you to donate $5 to this campaign. I ask that you pass this story on to another whom will do the same. Let's continue to spread love and compassion to those we love, and let that love extend to those that are loved by others. Thank you!

I will be leaving Seattle by the end of October. I can't afford to live here any longer, especially during this pandemic. After having covid in March and being sick for two months, I haven't been able to physically snap back as I had hoped. I still wake up with crackling in my throat and lungs on a daily basis. In addition, I've been experiencing significant bouts of what feels like chronic fatigue which lasts for 1-2 days. I also occasionally hear a clicking sound from my heart beat. I need time to rest and heal my body, but I unfortunately can't do that here. I'm too far behind on bills and rent which add up to about $2,500 I'm currently trying to get assistance from the utilities company, but they would only cover a small portion, and it's not 100% guaranteed. I haven't been able to get any unemployment during this pandemic and all of the savings I had are gone. It's too much for me to handle right now with my current energy levels. I'm setting the $ amount here at $5000 because I know the other portion of it will help me with my expenses moving forward. I have a Seattle friend who will be driving me up with a u-haul to Iowa. There I have a lifelong friend that I will be moving in with. After winter is over we plan to head to St. Paul, or Minneapolis to start over. There's so much uncertainty for all of us right now. If you can afford to give a little I would greatly appreciate it. I completely understand if you cannot. It's a very difficult time for us all. I'm sending you all so much love. Thank you for your friendship, your support, and your love. You've watched me grow into the person I am today, and I am so grateful for that. I love you so much. Thank you.

The guides and camp staff rely almost completely on the income they receive from assisting visitors as they explore Morocco and share their boundless enthusiasm and expertise in this fascinating country. The salary and tips they receive help them feed their families, send their children to school, and help pay for any social service needed such as medical care. Without tourists, they have no income stream and as the guides often are not affiliated with any official organizations, they are not receiving support or salaries during this time. March and April are typically their busiest season but COVID 19 has abruptly cut off their means of support.Wilderness Travel and our partners on the ground are organizing emergency financial relief to our amazing local guides, who lead our groups throughout Morocco and the hardworking Sahara desert camp crew who take such good care of our groups. We are hoping our past guests who visited Morocco will consider assisting us in these efforts. We’re asking for your help with donations to each of our camp staff and local guides. Our goal is to raise $6,000 USD.At the end of July, Moroccans celebrate their most important religious festival, Aid-el-Kebir (the “big feast”) to celebrate the end of Ramadan. Often called the Moroccan Thanksgiving, it is a time for families to get together and share special meals, often including lamb with couscous, over the course of three days. Parents also buy new clothes for their children to wear during the celebration and beyond. The Aid expenses typically run about $200-$300 for a family of 4. Wilderness Travel hopes to raise enough money in time to help the camp crew and our local guides celebrate their Thanksgiving this year.WT is not an NGO, nor do we have a non-profit arm, so these donations will not be tax-deductible.

ALS (or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) is a nervous system disease, which means it affects the abilities of the brain and spinal cord to maintain muscle control. Think Stephen Hawking. Although he has started to lose some control he is still able to be the amazing person that he is, but this will not last for as long as it should. Before he begins to lose more control and is no longer able to travel, I am trying to raise some money for my father and mother to take one last trip together (they have been married 26 years). He has been the best dad, father-in-law, husband, son, and most recently grandfather (or as he likes to say Grand Vader). He deserves everything and more, but I'm hoping with everyone's help we can at least give him a trip of a life time.

Have you ever been on an ABus Adventure? Would you like to participate in a grassroots attempt to purchase a vehicle for future rafting/hiking/biking/camping trips?

Vanna White is experiencing catastrophic engine failure:( and I am looking for help with replacing this adventure machine with a used/new to me 15 passenger van so that the fun doesn’t have to stop. Vanna White spent her life transporting kids, coworkers, friends, and strangers on so many free adventures that it’s difficult to count the river rafting trips, the cross country/multi day explorations, the Greenway bike trips, the mountain hiking trips, the moving/cargo hauling trips, the Cumberland trips, the community volunteer trips with kids helping grow and distribute food and many other fun, exciting, and life affirming events. Recently Vanna has been diagnosed with Engine failure that is cost prohibitive to repair. My goal is to salvage as much as possible and add it to a similar vehicle so that her legend may live on and continue to bring people and the joys of outdoor adventures together. If you’ve ever been or wanted to join in on ABus adventures, now is the time to donate a small medium or large sum of money to help offset the cost of providing these free trips to all the folks who value the fun and camaraderie that outdoor play offers to the spirit! While sharing in the cost is not required to anyone at any time, those who have adventured with us before know the costs that procuring and maintaining the gear for these trips is substantial. Your donations will be used to help bring another vehicle of adventure transport to life for future years of enjoyment to those that care to join and even those that just like to see the pictures and videos of people from all walks of life living life to the fullest in our beautiful outdoors:)

CNH tours was pivotal in setting up the first GoFundMe to help raise funds for The Samba Team, and they have passed the torch on to us to continue fundraising efforts. While to date, we’ve raised $54,008 from the first GoFundMe, this will only cover The Samba Team's basic food costs for the four months they’ve been out of work through the end of June. We’d like to support them through the end of the year, but let me explain why...BackgroundWhile COVID-19 has affected businesses all over the world, tourism-related businesses may be affected for a longer period than most others. While some are fortunate enough to live and operate in wealthier countries where social assistance may be available, in low-income countries, like Ecuador, these programs do not exist. Ecuador’s finances are among the worst in Latin America. In dealing with the pandemic, the Ecuadorian government does not even have enough cash to pay its civil servants, let alone provide social assistance to unemployed people.Approximately 70% of the Galapagos economy is directly or indirectly linked to tourism. Because of COVID-19, tourism has been shut down since mid-March. While Galapagos is controlling COVID-19 fairly well (barely 100 cases – almost half of which are the crew members of the Celebrity Flora), the population has been in a strict lock-down mode since late March.The Samba Team members are among those that face a hard several months, and that stretch will likely last through the end of the year. While they are paid better than average salaries by the Samba owner (the ship is one of the few that has been formally recognized by the national park for its social responsibility) and the crew enjoyed generous gratuities from our travelers, they do not typically have large savings and will increasingly find themselves in a difficult situation.  Cheesemans’ Relationship with The Samba TeamSince 2012, Cheesemans’ Ecology Safaris has led 15 in-depth, two-week trips on the Samba to experience the best of the Galapagos with Juan and his team, so approximately 210 people have joined Cheesemans' in the Galapagos. Since 2015, CNH Tours has helped approximately 1,100 people enjoy a wonderful Active Galapagos trip on the Samba. We are coordinating efforts with each other in hopes that we can take care of the basic needs of the families of The Samba Team who rely on these trips to make a livelihood. Thank you to those alumni who have already donated!Fund-raising objectiveThis amount would provide basic food for 20 families, who work directly or indirectly with The Samba Team, through the end of this year, all of whom are currently out of work, plus cover the transaction fees that GoFundMe charges (2.9% plus $0.30 per donation). A reasonable amount to cover the basic food costs for a family of four is $500 per month. Staples typically consist of rice, plantain, beans, onions, potatoes, fresh vegetables and fruit, fish, chicken, cooking oil, flour, and sugar.Distributing FundsWe will distribute these funds evenly among the 20 families regardless if we meet our objective. Funds will be transferred directly from Cheesemans’ Ecology Safaris to the Samba owners, who we’ve had a close relationship with since 2012, who will distribute it evenly among the 20 families. The Samba owners will not keep any of these funds.Comments from our TravelersThe Samba Team consistently receives glowing reviews from the trips we’ve shared with them.“Juan and his crew went above and beyond to ensure that every individual was treated well. I don't believe I have ever seen a similar level of attention for clients as they provided.” David L. Sparks, 2016  “Juan Manuel Salcedo and crew are top notch. Juan is a terrific leader - great breadth and depth of knowledge, and seems to effortlessly manage his crew and his clients. Always had us at the right place at the right time (for light, animal activity, etc).” Karen Perry, 2019“I looked forward to each day and had total confidence that Juan and the crew were going to do everything they could to make the experience educational, enjoyable and safe. I felt that they shared in our excitement as we explored and learned about the Galapagos.” LuAnn Ewan, 2017Thank you for your consideration!We know many people are in need, but this is one effort we can stand behind confidently; that it is going straight to folks in need, and that supports the Samba owners in providing socially responsible tourism for many years to come.

As such, Rangers need to be equipped with field uniforms and gear, much of which must be replaced on an annual basis given the demands of the environment and the frequency of use. This gear includes boots, socks, trousers, shirts, hats, backpacks, headlamps, water bottles, jackets, bedrolls, tents, binoculars, and GPS devices.June through September typically sees the most tourists in Namibia, however, COVID–19 has abruptly cut off this critical means of support. While we are happy to report that ranger salaries have been secured for another year, they will unfortunately not have funding for gear renewal until late 2021 at the earliest, which means some rangers will be wearing the same boots for two full years, covering 25 km a day in them.Wilderness Travel and our partners on the ground are organizing emergency financial relief to the amazing team of Namibian Rhino and Lion Rangers, some of whom you met on your trip with us. We are hoping you will consider assisting us in making sure these rangers have the gear they need to continue their critical work. Our goal is to raise $5,500 USD in support of a team of about 70 people.WT is not an NGO, nor do we have a non-profit arm, so these donations will not be tax-deductible.

On November 1, 2020, two local Cape Cod boys will embark on a once-in-a lifetime journey aboard a 28 foot Cape Dory sailboat. The two boys, Jan Lapinski and Ian Johnson, met in eighth grade at Monomoy Regional High School. They graduated in the Spring of 2019. They were both planning on returning to their respective colleges as sophomores. Jan was studying film at Ringling College of Art and Design and Ian was studying marine transportation at Massachusetts Maritime Academy. Because of Covid 19, necessary restrictions were placed on both of their otherwise very hands-on programs. Taking a gap year seemed a more logical alternative to virtual learning. It also presented an opportunity to really think outside the box and search for something that would give life experience and adventure: cue MICRON.Their considerations included:1. Something in which they could socially distance.2. Something that would push them beyond the edge of their comfort zone. 3. Something that would fulfill their shared feeling of wanderlust. 4. And most importantly, something that would enhance their education in their individual majors.      The Voyage of MICRON was just the experience they were looking for as it hit all the marks, and would allow for travel with minimum exposure and risk of Covid 19. The Voyage also fulfills their educational needs. Ian will have hands-on experience navigating long distances at sea, as well as, learning practical knowledge of what life would be like on a boat. Jan plans on creating a multi-media portfolio that will consist of: a film chronicling their experience as sailors, students and volunteers carrying out conservation efforts; a multi-episode YouTube series on the challenges that arise when living on a sailboat; and finally a photography portfolio documenting the beautiful, chaotic, scary, tranquil, dirty, exhausting and breathtaking experiences of sailing the sea.We need your help to make our dream a reality.     When on the water for that amount of time it's inevitable that things will go wrong. That's why we’re asking for your help to raise money towards making sure the sailing vessel is safe, prepared, and capable of all that we have planned for it. We can't wait to share with the world how we're able to find beauty, education, and self fulfillment during these grim and unforeseen times. Please help us make our dream come true as we prepare to set sail by donating to our voyage.For more information visit our website at www.TheMicronVoyage.comSincerely,Jan Lapinski and Ian Johnson ​

Erin and I are acting as mentors for this trip and are so excited we’ve been asked to lead this group. Thanks to Logos Wilderness Therapy, this group of women will be spending a few days in the backcountry of Wyoming for an experience of healing, encouragement, and community. Almost all the expenses of the backcountry trip will be covered by Logos Wilderness Therapy but we need your help to cover the remaining cost. We are raising $6,500 to cover the cost of six plane tickets, a few days in an Airbnb to adjust to the altitude before being in the backcountry, and gear for the wilderness trip. During the few days before the backcountry trip. Our group will engage in team-building activities, survivor leaders from the surrounding community will come to share their experiences of success and achievement. We want to make this a life-changing and unforgettable trip for these women. We want them to come out of this knowing how much they are loved and cared for by the community, to know that there is a world of possibility for them, and most importantly that they feel the power of their inner strength and internal resources. Because most of these women have never been on a plane, have never experienced high altitudes, and have never gone across the country to spend a few days off-grid with people who are practically strangers, Erin and I want to help these women navigate these new experiences and help them be psychically and emotionally prepared for the trip. We have already been engaging with the group in training activities, and collectively these survivors have walked over 60 miles over bridges of Jacksonville to prepare for incline. We have some nature hikes planned and another trip in the works to expose the women to rock scrambling. These women are just as dedicated as Erin and I, if not more, in making the most out of this trip. We know this will be an experience that will help these survivors stretch out into the growth zone, find new confidence in themselves, bring healing in their hearts, and develop a new sense of community with one another. We hope you will consider being a part of this experience of renewal and hope for these amazing survivors of trafficking.

Be part of one of the greatest unsolved  mysteries the world has ever known.

I have been cruising the Pacific for six years. I have sailed from the states to the South Pacific and up and down between the Marshall Islands and New Zealand, which is where I am currently located waiting for next season.

Being a pilot have always been fascinated with Amelia Earhart’s fate.

My plan is to search a line in the Pacific along her last reported route. Using MBES sonar, side scan sonar and other non-invasive means available. Searching near the islands and atolls along her last reported route. Using a fine toothed comb approach, this will be a time consuming and tedious venture, but worth the reward of possibly solving this mystery.The boat I have now is not quite adequate for this mission. I do have the time, passion and ocean experience to partake on this mission. I can dedicate many years to this project.The funds will be used to purchase boat, equipment and some operating expense.The boat I will use is a Circa FPB 64, currently located in New Zealand. I will need to purchase the boat and equipment before heading out.There are millions of people that would like to learn what happened and where.Be part of the team, a one, five or ten dollar donation will add up and is very appreciated.

This is a grassroots  expedition.  Expected launch June, 2021This mission won’t have  time constraints or any kind of corporate obligations.

I am also considering to take a volunteer crew member. Possibly chosen from drawing from interested  parties.  Let me know what you think of this idea.                                     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amelia_Earhart                                                                                                 Me with crashed Japanese Zero in Marshall Islands.

Over the last six months I, as well as other guides and porters who I regularly hire for treks, have not had any work and have not been able to earn our normal living.Each trekking season I regularly hire 24 Sherpa guides and porters who each need approximately $250US  per month for basics such as food, housing, water and other necessities of life for their families.  Normally what we earn during the two trekking seasons, Spring and Autumn, are enough to tide us through the whole year. We understand the lockdown is important for the health and safety of everyone and that is has been going for over 80 days. The government lockdown has broken the backbone of our economic condition. During this lockdown, one of my  German friends and I did distribute some food to my sherpa guides and porters. But he can not financially continue to support all of us.  I have run out of my savings and am taking loans to tide us through this difficult period. Also, I have to look out for my family and I am the only person who earns money in my family. I am very worried about my Sherpa guides and porters who have a very difficult situation in this crisis.  If you can please help with any amount to help my guides and porters and their families, it would be deeply appreciated. All money raised on this page will go directly to help each of the 24 families I work with. Thank you for supporting us. -Kami Tenzing Sherpa----------Hello, my name is Peter Carey and I am helping my friend and guide Kami Sherpa organize this GoFundMe campaign. Kami contacted me in August about the dire need his family, and others who he regularly employs, currently face and I agreed to set up this page and forward all funds raised so he can distribute them in Nepal.While Nepal recently lifted their travel restrictions, the country does not have the virus under control and is currently experiencing a rise in cases and deaths, as in many countries around the world. They also have inadequate testing and tracing which is keeping away the vast majority of tourists this Fall trekking season (which runs from late September through November)This page is attempting to partially alleviate the lost wages of those Kami regularly hires. Trekking, and the business it generates, is the backbone of those who live in the Himalayas and there are few, if any, other options for income. The funds raised will help these families struggle through the Fall trekking season with practically zero outside visitors coming to trek. My goal is to offer photography trekking tours in Nepal for the Fall 2021 season, pandemic permitting, to bring Kami and his group much needed business.To say this group of wonderful guides and porters would rather be working than asking for assistance is a severe understatement. They love sharing the beauty and majesty of the Himalayas, their home, with those who visit.More information about future photo tours to Nepal can be found  HERE .Thank you for your consideration and support.-pwc

The salary and tips they receive help them feed their families, send their children to school, pay for medical bills, and pay rent. Without tourists, they have no income stream and are receiving little to no financial support locally. COVID–19 has abruptly cut off their means of income this year and it isn’t clear when tourism will fully resume.Wilderness Travel is organizing an emergency financial relief fund to help our local guides and drivers in their time of need. Our goal is to raise $7,000 USD.WT is not an NGO, nor do we have a non-profit arm, so these donations will not be tax-deductible.

Hi every one my name is Bella Hubbard, I have created this page to raise money for my younger cousin Keely. She is 15 years old and a quadriplegic which means she is paralyzed from the neck down. She speaks every other breath through a machine that helps her breathe. This in itself is amazing , since she started out not speaking at all when this all happened .....A little recap on Keely’s journey . It started on February 25th 2017. She had run a 4 mile race with her mom (Aunt Tracy) and carried on with a normal afternoon. The next day, February 26th she woke up with flu like symptoms, she went to the doctor and things went down hill quickly. She had a form of meningitis. On the way to the hospital from the doctors office she had a stroke, stopped breathing was resuscitated and then rushed into immediate brain surgery to save her life . The once fun, outgoing, and adventurous girl I knew was now fighting for her life. The next three years of her life we’re going to put her and her family through the most painful and trying times . Once a girl who loved to bake, play soccer, and run was only able to get around by moving her wheel chair by mouth .Keely has adapted to her new normal , yet still strives to adventure as she did years ago . This is where Tik Tok actually came in handy and did something positive for us .... besides wasting hours of time watching videos of nonsense..... I saw the video of this super cool wheelchair and thought of Keely immediately. This would be perfect for her !!!! I would like to be able to provide my cousin with an all terrain wheelchair so she can have the ability to adventure , explore and experience life like she should be. Please help if you can , a couple dollars would be amazing !!! Anything you donate will help Keely go kick life’s Butt .

Drua i Vola Sigavou, which means The New Rising Star, is a replica of the last surviving traditional Fijian sailing canoe or drua. The Drua Experience social enterprise built their replica drua based on the 1913 Ratu Finau Drua that has been housed in the Fiji Museum for decades. 
The goal of this campaign is to revive Fiji sailing culture and traditional canoe building through awareness raising and youth training. Reviving traditional sailing will also open for sustainable sea transport and shipping, directly supporting the mitigation of climate change in the Pacific. The funds raised through this campaign will be used to sail the Drua i Vola Sigavou to the Lau Islands in Fiji and conduct traditional sailing and canoe building training with youth on Lau. Despite being the ancestors of the greatest canoe builders in the Pacific, the people of Lau have not seen a drua for 30 years, when the last one set sail to Suva, Fiji’s capital. Specifically donations will be used for communications, taxes and permit fees, safety and sailing equipment,  film production and editing, living stipend, and land travel costs.The Drua Experience Team will film and document the sailing journey to raise awareness on the importance, history and traditions of the drua. At each stop along the sail plan, the team will research and record story and traditional knowledge related to the drua and its origins. All recordings will be kept available for researchers and future training. Upon return, this knowledge will be used to build the Traditional Canoe Building Training Program. The program will support youth in Fiji to learn how to build and sail their own traditional canoes. Youth training in the Lau Islands will include:- History and Legacy of the Great Drua- Drua Construction including uses of native trees - Tying Knots - Sailing Practice and Drua Parts and Components -Traditional Navigation Practices The Drua Experience is well versed in implementing projects. In 2018-19, they received a grant from IUCN to establish a training program for Suva youth on sailing the Fijian Drua. The team was able to train 183 youths on the history and sailing of the drua. In 2020, the Drua Experience received a grant from the US Embassy to training 200 youths on the western side of Fiji in a similar program. The team trained more than 100 youths before the training was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Until the impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic, the Drua Experience ran as a tourism social enterprise, providing traditional sailing experiences. However, given the impacts of the pandemic, the Drua Experience is now facing a shortage of income, which will impact the sustainability of the drua and its crew. The Drua Experience is under the Sailing For Sustainable Company which is owned by Dr Peter Nutall and Allison Newell. We are registered as a commercial Trading business with all safety and regulation required by the Maritime Safety Of Fiji. SponsorshipAll sponsors that donate will be noted in the credits of the final film for their sponsorship as well as given at least one social media “shout out” during the journey.

For the past 4 years, I have been operating a food truck called Sumo Egg Rolls. Never in a million years would I have imagined that my business would  transform into a youth driven organization. In the summer of 2020, I decided to run a trial youth program that consisted of eight youth. You can see more of what we did this past summer at our website: https://www.sumoeggrolls.com/program The Sumo Voyager youth group is about giving youth an opportunity to explore the very cities they live in though the use of a scooter. To accomplish this goal, I am asking for your financial support. I am hoping to raise $8,000 dollars to purchase ten scooters. 1 Ninebot ES4 scooter = $79910 Ninebot ES4 scooters = $7,999 + taxesFAQsQ: What is your mission: A: Our Mission: To explore new lands, to seek out adventures, to boldly go where no scooter has gone before.Q: Who benefits from this fundraiser?A: This fundraiser is for the 2021 youth program. I personally will not get any financial  benefit out this. I do this out of my own time, freewill, and inner calling. Q: How do I know my donation will go towards the youth?A: I have a bank account dedicated specifically for the youth program. Every penny that I ever gotten from donations has gone into the youth program account. I even spent my own money to make sure the 2020 youth program ran smoothly. Q: Why should you donate?A: -You should donate if you feel connected to this post in anyway.-You should donate because you've seen what we have accomplished and want to continue supporting our goal.-You should donate because you believe that today's youth are our future leaders.The success of the  2021 Sumo Voyager youth program is counting on your support.

Most of the islands and companies have done an amazing job rebuilding and reopening their doors to welcome our beloved tourists.After picking up our first “new” boat, a 45' day sail specific catamaran, in March 2018, to replace our boats lost in the storms, we decided to invest in a second identical sailboat in October 2019... AND, our seasoned crew returned to run it!Last season started off as a promising one, until….Mid-March the government put a halt on all cruise ships and closed our airports to incoming traffic. For us that meant that we did our last charter on March 20th.The times that followed, we were introduced to a soft curfew, no gatherings larger than 20 people. Shortly after that we were on a full 24 hour lockdown... no walks, no shopping... only essential workers were allowed out. We were asked to provision first for one week, then we were all allowed out for one day (spread out over 3 days), to re-provision for another two weeks.The consensus was that our government reacted very firmly but fair and in all of our best interests.Borders for now remain closed to non-residents and we are not sure when the borders will officially open to tourists.But one thing we do know: This will pass... we are resilient.We realize that we’re all weathering the same storm at this moment. But after a brainstorm session with the crew, we came up with with some pretty great ideas to keep our company and crew afloat.As most of you can imagine, the running costs for a boat are pretty steep and ongoing. This includes docking, insurance, storage, and of course the crew we all got to know and love.So we came up with a plan...To generate revenue, we'd like to invite everyone who plans on visiting the BVI and sailing with us at any point in the future to pay at least 20% now (or more, depending on the three savings levels listed above) to lock in significant savings!  This includes our guarantee that if you need to cancel at any time, you’ll receive a full refund, no questions asked!You would be helping us tremendously by enabling us to take proper care of our business and crew!We look forward to welcoming you on board and offering you a great day of sailing, snorkeling, and paddleboarding the beautiful waters and islands of the BVI soon!Stay safe,The Aristocat Crew - Scott, Brittany, Jorn, Kendall, Luuck, and Darcy

*  Visit with family and friends in Iowa and Missouri. 
*  skydive (!?!? -- we're not so sure about this one! )

To keep myself from getting too emotional, I’m going to keep it short and straight to the point.


Decisions were made in my absence that have a huge impact on life, and effects my current living situation. To keep myself from facing housing insecurities, again I’ve decided to be as proactive possible. 


I feel as though  Kansas City is my next move for the next year. To help myself gain a better clarity, and understanding on the trajectory of my life. As well as focus on myself and my script.


As many of you are aware, I don’t work a job, in the traditional sense,  with a pay stub to prove and income and that makes applying for places a little bit more difficult. I have already began to take the steps to look for a placed and I have my mind and heart set on a property but they’re asking for the entire years rent, plus deposit, upfront at move in on September 15th. That means I need to very ambitiously attempt to raise $20k in a little over a month. I know it’s a lot, and I wish I was able to completely finance it myself, but I can’t, and that’s why I’m humbly asking for all the help I can get  


Honestly I’m finding myself too emotionally distraught and hurt to focus on anything else as I’m currently this, and  I wish  I could spend the few weeks finishing my script and having it ready in time for a table read on my birthday, but once again, I can’t.  


I apologize in advance for not being able gather (via zoom) to celebrate my birthday as originally planned. Once I’m settled in a place physically, emotionally, and even mentally I’ll continue to write the script as promised. And share it as soon as I can. 


thank you all for being understanding during an already difficult and confusing time. 


❤️-Tracye

It has been on my mind since the death of my beloved grandfather in 2007. After thirteen years of wishing, I have the chance to make it come true.My grandparents were named Arthur and Annie Stone, and they were the children of sharecroppers. They too were sharecroppers until the 1960s, when they were able to purchase their farm outright. They raised three daughters there, including my mama. When Papa died, Nanny could not run the farm on her own, and my mom and her sisters made the choice to sell it. I was 17 at the time, and the longing for that farmhouse with the dark green shutters has stayed on my shoulders all these years since. Simply put: I am going to try to buy it back. Miraculously, the current owner is looking to sell it.This is the one chance I’ll ever have to do this.For me, the story begins in 1995, the first of countless times I remember piling in the car with my siblings and parents, driving the three and a half hours from Atlanta, GA, to Nanny and Papa’s house in Petersburg, TN. This farmhouse was where we spent countless happy Thanksgivings, Christmases, and summer holidays.But for Arthur and Annie stone, the story starts 150 years before that. To the period just after the American Civil War called Reconstruction. Quick history lesson if you need one: Agriculture was the economic force of the Southern United States, and the enslavement of people descended from stolen Africans kept the economy afloat. After the enslaved became freedmen, General Sherman proposed that the land seized from former Confederates should be divided among the freedmen, as repayment for their treatment. This is commonly referred to as Forty Acres and a Mule, and it was a promise that wasn’t kept. Instead, the land was returned to the former Confederates who previously owned it. The land needed to be worked. And there was an entire population -- only recently considered citizens in their own right -- who needed work and food and security. Enter: sharecropping. Sharecropping was an exploitative model. It worked like this: a tenant would live on and work a portion of a landowner’s plantation, farm, or land. In exchange, that tenant kept a (usually small) portion of the crop come harvest time. Sharecroppers had very little agency. They didn’t own their own equipment, they were forced to accept the prices the landowners were willing to pay, and if they stuck up for themselves they risked their livelihood and family home. In the last years of her life, Nanny told me that she had taken to being pen pals with the son of the landowner she sharecropped for. He apologized for the ways he and his family had wronged my grandparents. It is no small feat that these people -- my people -- born not even 60 years after the dissolution of slavery, broke the mold of their families and somehow overcame admitted wrongdoing. That feels like another miracle. If all I ever accomplished in my life was buying back my grandparents’ farm and restoring it to something they would be proud of, that would be enough. I want to live a life where my siblings and our children can go back there for holidays. I want my mama to spend more Thanksgivings or Christmases there in her life. So I am asking you to please help me get my ancestral home back. I would appreciate anything you can contribute. And if you are not in a position to donate, all I ask is that you share the link to this campaign with everyone you can think of. Nanny and Papa spent their entire lives in the picturesque state of Tennessee; living through the roaring twenties, the great depression, Jim Crow, the Civil Rights movement, and so much more. Their lives make up the history of that land. It’s now on me to determine the future of it. Thank you for your help.

Update from Key:Dear ones, thank you so much for your support and willingness to dream with us! We have submitted a cash offer to the bank and they have countered at a much higher number than we anticipated - it looks like capitalism isn’t going to let this land come home without a fight. We are preparing to do battle and are raising our goal to 100k. We refuse to give up on this freedom dream and hope you will join us in our struggle to return this land to Black stewardship!

—We met our goal of $50,000! We did it! Thank you so much everybody. We are raising our goal to $70,000 in case there is a counter-offer + to support needed repairs. Thank you for keeping the love flowing!We are raising the funds to buy back a house that sits on Carlin's people's land. It was sold some 48 years ago, and today: it is for sale. We must move swiftly to obtain the necessary funds and return this land to the Black family who have stewarded it for generations.Please write the organizers for more detailed info on sending large donations via wire transfer <3---Update from Carlin on July 4 + photos of the land:The outpouring of support has been so great I am beside myself. In less than 24 hours we are almost halfway to our goal to reacquire this land. For all who have given and for all who are considering, we say thank you from the bottom of hearts for being willing to support our freedom dreams. My family and I are blown away. With your support I hope to place an offer on the property in the next 72 hours.We are looking forward to creating a safe space for our people (TGNC, Queer, BIPOC organizers, artists, teachers, healers and those who might just need to get loved on for a while) to come rest, dream, and strategize. We are trusting and believing that this is possible. We are trusting and believing that we will be able to pour even more love back into this home that has held us. Stewardship and love was my grandparents’ vision for this land and that is my goal. ---Carlin's words:There is a patch of land in North Carolina where freedom grows. The seeds were planted by my grandfather's hands over 70 years ago and have been nurtured by my family each generation since. As a child I would look out and over what he had held for us for so long and picture the unspeakable acts of terror bestowed upon the land by white men washed away by the unimaginable strength and goodness and love that my family soaked back into the earth year after year. In this time many of us find ourselves wondering what it means to find home, to fight for freedom and to hold onto it by any means necessary. This moment holds more truth and possibility and bitterness than we could have ever collectively imagined. This moment also holds within it a possibility for a return to the land. There is a house, a tired and seen many-a-thing house that sits on the land my grandfather planted those freedom seeds on. It was removed from my family's possession 48 years ago, and today - it is for sale. It is no small thing to be called to a place. It is a larger thing still to let myself hope that there is a possibility of return. As a Black Queer southern organizer, fighting for the freedom of my people is my birthright. I am seeking a reclamation of what it means to be free and am reaching out to you for support in realizing it. We have a limited amount of time to raise the money required to bring the house and the land home again. I am humbly asking for those who feel called, to give what you are able. In making this request of my community I am fighting against losing hope. Any and everything would be a blessing. In the greatest love, Carlin

He passed away of a massive heart attack at the young age of 42. Pradeep was a wonderful son, brother, husband, and a devoted father. He had the biggest smile, a warm heart, and a caring personality. He nurtured and treasured the friendships he cultivated beginning from his childhood through school and higher education. He was a loyal friend and companion to many, never skipping an opportunity to be nostalgic about his memories with each and every one of his friends. Pradeep’s warmth extended beyond his friends and family to his professional relationships as well. Pradeep was an introspective leader, always prepared to show up in support of his team, and always willing to go the extra mile. He had a keen eye for discovering talent and was a great mentor, focused on motivating others to believe in themselves. He was a great storyteller and a keen listener who could keep a conversation engaging and fun for colleagues and friends alike. His compassion and empathy helped him communicate almost anything with the appropriate smile, always managing to come across reassuring.Pradeep was Super Dad to his kids! He always found the time to watch the Mandalorian with his son, Aarav Nayar, and do Art for Kids Hub with his daughter, Aanya Nayar. Despite wanting to travel to different places in the world, he chose to take several trips to Disney because he felt like he was able to connect with the kids the most while waiting to get on the rides.We all miss him dearly and do not know how we will ever fill the void left by his absence. This seems to be the common sentiment as different facets of his life and the positive impact he had in his short life have come to light after his death.Pradeep was passionate about teaching, coaching, and mentoring others and wanted to make a memorable contribution to the UX community. He harbored the desire to build a non-profit educational fund to support young designers in their career journey.We are establishing this fund to make some of his incomplete aspirations come true. The proceeds from the fund will be split between initiatives that support educational initiatives in the UX community and college savings for his kids, Aarav, and Aanya. We are currently reaching out to multiple organizations of Pradeep's choice to direct the funds. We will post updates soon. We miss you Pradeep! We hope that your legacy lives on in the people whose lives you have touched and made better in some way.

My name is Candace Jennifer and since 2014 I have had one dream; to open a BIPOC-centered urban farm and wholeness center in Winooski, VT.  I'm calling on my community to help me bring this dream to life.  WCAX Made in Vermont Segment: https://www.wcax.com/content/news/MiVT-Conscious-Kitchen-Medicinals-571422881.html{On Wholeness}When we choose to be in our wholeness... ...we reject the ways our culture of dominance, colonialism, capitalism and oppression divide us from the land as well as our individual and collective wholeness....we take responsibility for healing the wounds & woundings of our ancestors....we collect the parts of ourselves that we are told need to be tucked away and hidden in the periphery to hold space for all of our parts to show up fully and honestly at the center. ...we align with our purpose and claim our capacity and potential to be fully who we are here to be....we care for ourselves, each other and the earth; living WITH not OVER the land or one another....we co-create a way to live our lives in liberation and with love as our teacher....we choose to be free from the veils of illusion that cloud our minds and distract us from being the whole being we were born to be. ...we are choosing to love ourselves unconditionally.Are you ready to live in your wholeness?{Conscious Homestead & Wholeness Center} - (Our Vision for Community Offerings)*Recalling Our Landcestors Mentorship: a BIPOC urban homesteading mentorship program that centers on decolonizing our relationship to the land.*Botanica: a small shop that offers herbs, medicinals and products made with ingredients sourced from the homestead urban farm.*Urban Farm Stand: offering homestead, urban farm grown veggies, herbs, flowers and eggs from our backyard flocks.*Learning Kitchen:  an outdoor cooking and learning space where ancestral food and herbalism classes are offered*Classes/Workshops/Gatherings/1:1 Support Services: a small sacred space offering BIPOC centered, trauma-conscious workshops, classes, small gatherings and 1:1 support & services focused on liberation, decolonization and healing{About Candace}I am many things. Daughter to Camille and Frank. Granddaughter to Frank, Dorothy, Jewel and Goldbourne.Sister to Adrian, Leisa, Maurice, Kevin, Kenson and Karreell.I am mother to David Justus.I am life-partner to Tony.As a child of colonization, many of my ancestors names remain unknown to me because they were displaced from Africa in the TransAtlantic slave trade. Our families broken apart; our connection to the land of our lineage severed. Yet, these ancestors are not lost to me, they live in me, breathe through me, guide me, teach me, nourish me. In turn I honor them by prioritizing and dedicating myself to the practice of midwifing these ancient bonds that make me Candace.Some of my ancestors names are unknown to me because they were likely the ones who stole, raped, enslaved and murdered my African ancestors; ripping us from our lands and families in pursuit of greed and false power. Yet these ancestors are also not lost to me, they too live in me, breathe through me, guide and teach me. In turn I honor them by alchemizing their lineage of toxic oppression and transform it into a new path for justice, healing, resistance and love. I am a servant and steward of nature; some may want to call me witch, bruja, shamaness, healer, herbalist, urban farmer or homesteader. For me, so many of these words, titles, labels don’t completely resonate like servant and steward of nature. My relationship with the land and its rhythms is a birthright that I humbly nurture as I observe the land both outside and within me. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  Education:Master’s degree in Interdisciplinary Education from University of Vermont(graduated with honors, Pi Gamma Mu)Bachelor’s degree in American Studies & Education from Smith CollegeAdvanced Yoga Studies, 300 HR, from Hathavidya in Classical Hatha YogaYoga Certification200 HR, from Laughing River Yoga in Hatha YogaHolistic Health Coach Certification from Hathavidya Inner Harmony ProgramReiki Certification, Level 2, from Reiki Master Anne CameronHealing Touch Certification, Level 1, from University of VermontLabor & Birth/Postpartum Doula CertificationRadical Herbal Allyship Program* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  Professional Experience:Over 15 years in Higher Education - Undergraduate Admissions, Student Affairs and Diversity & EquityOver 10 years in Food - Customer Service, Personal Chef, Food Education & Mentorship, Catering, Holistic Health Coaching, Permaculture, Urban Farming & Homesteading, Produce Manager, Farm-to-School Chef, Line Cook, Prep Cook, Senior Cook, Head Chef.Over 20 years in Social Justice - Community Organizing, Advocacy, Education & Training, Outreach, Board WorkOver 15 years in Trauma - Gender-Based & Sexual Violence, Rape Culture, Anti-Oppression, Healing

Tragedy struck the family with a freak accident involving Robbie. So many of the Oxley's friends, family, first responders, strangers were on the scene immediately to come to Robbie’s aid. Their fast actions from the first minute until First Respose arrived, through the ambulance ride to the hospital to the amazing team of trama doctors who worked on him in the ER - they all gave him time to fight for his life. He had the best team of doctors, nurses and specialists doing all they could for sweet Robbie. Unfortunately his injuries were too severe to pull through, but he is going to be a true SUPERHERO. Robbie will live on, saving the lives of several other girls and boys waiting on a second chance. Let's come together to support this family and keep Robbie's legacy alive, Emilie's heart bright, the entire family strong, and see what we can grow out of our community for Robbie, Emilie, Nancy, and Keith.

Though she was young and had been healthy and active, Molly fought a series of sudden medical conditions the past two months. Molly was a source of light and joy in so many lives in Austin and in her native Hawaii. Molly edited many award-winning films and other projects, and all of us who worked with her valued her vision, patience and humor. She managed to do what most of us dream of accomplishing: she left the world a better place than she found it. 
Molly’s daughter Ciara is now a Senior at Austin High, and our hearts go out to her and the family. Ciara is active in the theater program at Austin High and is looking at universities that will support her goal of writing for new media. Ciara is a wonderful young woman and we hope you can join this effort to support her dreams. Any amount big or small will make a real difference in her way forward.Molly and Ciara were a team that took on life together. Molly’s recent Facebook posts about special times with Ciara included watching Ciara acting in theater at Austin High and the two of them sending 300 hand-written postcards to Arizona voters! Here are Molly’s thoughts about the excitement and challenges of high school in 2020. Those challenges have now taken on a new dimension:I am the parent of a 2021 high school Senior!!We have some idea of what we’re up against: uncertainty, cancellations, restrictions, changes, inconveniences and disappointments. But we will take these uncertainties and create an opportunity to grow. We will pray.We will learn.We will fight.We will create new where we need to. We will fight for celebrations and hope and joy and laughter and ceremonies and milestones and ORDINARY days and the future.I am the parent of a 2021 senior and I am not giving up on this year.Okay, Molly. Neither will we. Love to you all.A little housekeeping required by GoFundMe: Even though The Nobelity Project is a non-profit organization, contributions to Ciara's College Fund are not tax-deductible. We are accepting these gifts to Ciara on behalf of the family until  they open an educational savings account for Ciara.   The Nobelity Project will also cover the 3% fees deducted by GoFundMe for the online processing so that every dollar donated here will make it to Ciara for college expenses. If you have any questions or would like to contribute directly to this fund outside of GoFundMe please feel free to contact us at The Nobelity Project. Christy, Turk and Liz.

You feel refreshed and alive! There is just something about a great haircut that puts a bounce back in your step! Unfortunately, the cost of a haircut is often not within reach as some must first prioritize where their next meal is coming from or where they will be sleeping that night. My name is Joshua Santiago and I am a barber based out of Philadelphia. I am the founder of Empowering Cuts, a non-profit organization that travels the country providing free haircuts to the homeless, military veterans, children, and families who are experiencing financial hardships. I know all too well what it is like to not be able to afford something as simple as a haircut. When I was a child, my father would cut my hair and mess it up every time because we didn’t have the money to afford the luxury of going to a barbershop. As an adult, I enrolled in barber school where my life and outlook changed forever. My barber instructor would take the entire class to shelters, offering free haircuts. This is how we learned how to cut hair professionally. Being able to bless someone meant more to me than to actually receive money for it. Over the last 4 years, Empowering Cuts has worked with over 50 organizations in over 20 different cities from coast-to-coast. We have been featured in roughly 10 different written and visual news outlets. Last but certainly not least, we have been responsible for grooming over 7,500 men, women and children all over the country, FREE OF CHARGE. We don’t just cut hair. We wash it, style it, and have even done nails and makeup for women, as well, all in the hopes of brightening someone’s day! Empowering Cuts also understands while some people may not be experiencing homelessness, they simply need some hope and light in their life. We have actively sought after these individuals and surprised them with thousands of dollars in donations contributed through the Empowering Cuts’ Social Media community on Instagram and Facebook. The help we have been able to give these individuals has ranged from money to food, drinks, cleaning supplies, hygiene supplies and full grooming services all thanks to the generous donations of people just like you! We Want To Do MORE and you can HELP!! I have purchased a 32’ camper RV to be able to use it as a mobile location for Empowering Cuts! We will use this camper to travel the country frequently and provide hope to the communities we touch. Through your generous donations, the camper will be fitted with: ·        Flooring·        Proper lighting·        3 barber chairs·        Barber stations·        A sanitary bathroom·        Shampoo bowl station·        Electrical and plumbing·        A Lounge Area·        Auto Repairs/Mechanic·        Auto body painting This will allow me to be more mobile and help even more individuals on the road doing my life’s work while offering FREE barber services to even more people in need! Your help in transforming this RV into the mobile headquarters of Empowering Cuts will allow you to see that you are not only investing in me, Joshua Santiago, but you are investing in your fellow brothers and sisters all across the country. I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your support! Additionally, I welcome you to join me on my journey as I highlight the lives and experiences of our homeless men and women across the country which will be shared on our social media. Please take the time to share my campaign with your family, friends, and loved ones. Together, we can brighten someone’s day and bring hope to their future!

She is a hard-working single mother who has supported her son and mother through childcare, cleaning, and managing cleaning teams for many of our neighbors in Ladera as well. She was diagnosed with cancer over two years ago, and was treated with excellent medical care by Stanford doctors. Her remission did not last, however, and she has been through chemo, radiation and immunotherapy over the past year, supported by many of you, her close family, and her incredible optimism and deep faith.  Julisa had a recent pet/PT scan that revealed the terrible news that the cancer has spread widely. Because no further medical treatment can resolve this, she is now in palliative care for the short time that doctors have said remains to her. Julisa describes herself as a hopeful person of faith. She remains hopeful and at peace at this time. We would like to give Julisa the comfort of knowing that there is funding for her family and for her son Edwin’s education.  He graduated from high school a year ago, and has been working hard to help support the family and continue Julisa’s cleaning services business during her illness. We will be mentoring him and helping him find the education he needs for a viable career. This is so very important to Julisa at this time, as you can imagine. Please show your support by donating to this fund that will provide financial security and education for Edwin and support for Julisa. She would never ask for anything, but we are asking for her. And Julisa would love to hear from all of the people who care so much about her, so please write to her soon if you can. With heavy hearts and many thanks, Linda FornaciariLeigh Johnson---------------------------------------------------------------------------October 13, 2020I am updating all of you very generous donors as we work towards concluding our campaign to support Julisa and Edwin. I want to clarify that the wonderful funds donated will be withdrawn into an account held by Julisa's sister, Yesenia Zavaleta (Jessie) who, at Julisa's request, will manage the use of the funds for the family and Edwin's education. I met yesterday with Julisa, who sends all of you her love and thanks, and with Jessie and Edwin.  I have great confidence in Julisa's choice of the person to manage the donations and account and want to thank all of you again for supporting Julisa and Edwin. Several of us will continue to work with Jessie and Edwin as he pursues his education.Julisa’s famous smile was very apparent as she contemplates a great future for Edwin and thinks of all of you with love and gratitude.  We have told her she does not need to thank each of you herself, since that would be a huge job at this time so please let us thank you for her.  THANK YOU!Linda Fornaciari

I am making this GoFundMe because my family is in great need of financial support. To simplify my story: my father passed away this summer and my mother was incarcerated on the  same day. I am a first-generation and low-income student, and I would like to reach out for help in paying for things I never thought I would have to worry about: life insurance, real estate property taxes, water bills, electric bills, and so on. Not only will I be juggling academic responsibilities this upcoming fall semester, but I will also be taking care of my siblings and home in North Philadelphia (Kensington). There is more for me to discover about the real world, but one pressing matter for me is money. To help alleviate this, I will be working 20 hours a week this upcoming semester, but it will not be enough to handle everything, as all of my home responsibilities were not meant to be handled by one person.Your support will enable me to continue being a steward for others, ease a hungering curiosity for science, and to take the steps necessary to give back as I transition into a working professional. In my years at Haverford College, I have created a brand for myself in running Chess Club. Despite being a mediocre player in chess, I love to teach others about it and influence my friends into it. Chess saved me from the dark places when I was growing up, and it’s always been a dream of mine to just show others how focusing on a checkerboard can do so much to help ease the mind. More than just a game, I also use chess as a catalyst to help teach youth in the neighboring Ardmore community at Haverford. This semester, I will virtually continue to run Chess Club with my team, and I will do so to help provide a sanctuary for others, as it’s always been for me. For my mission of Chess Club, it’s always been about “others” and I will continue this more than ever.Your generosity will allow me to continue my pursuit of a college degree and become the first in my family to graduate from college. I am grateful for your consideration. Thank you for reading,Jr

By now, the news has spread about the untimely and tragic passing of our beloved Elena Ferretti. Anyone who knew Elena was touched by her heart of gold. She spent her days quietly serving and caring for those around her.

On the evening of October 20, Elena passed away suddenly and unexpectedly. Elena was in the midst of receiving her very first round of immunotherapy for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center when she experienced an unforeseen—and fatal—adverse reaction during her treatment. Elena, a devoted and proud single mother, leaves behind her beautiful and brilliant 15-year-old daughter Elliott.

We have put this fundraiser together for the person who will undoubtedly miss Elena and her care the most: Elliott. Your financial contributions will help secure funding for Elliott to finish out her high school education at Avenues and eventually attend a college of her choosing, while also providing monetary support for additional future educational needs. Elena had magnanimous hopes and dreams for her daughter and we have been blown away by the outpouring of love and support, wondering what can be done to help during this painful time. We've created this fundraiser to help ensure that Elliott can continue living the gorgeous life Elena always dreamt of for her.

We thank you from the bottom of our hearts for any contribution. We kindly ask that you please respect the family's privacy during this extraordinarily difficult time."

She is now using a power wheelchair, utilizing the mobility she has in her left, non-dominant hand to operate the joystick. Because of the fact that my mom spent the years before her symptoms raising four kids and going back to school for Social Work (graduating a year before her symptoms became debilitating),  she did not earn enough  work credits and therefore does not qualify for disability assistance. She is still ten years away from being eligible for Medicare. This means that full-time home care, assistive technology, and home modifications have been and will continue to be out of pocket expenses for my family.  Currently, we have no way to transport my mom outside of the house in her power chair due to its weight. Our hope is to get my mom an accessible van so that she can participate in and enjoy the things she used to do, such as visiting friends and family, going to church, going up to Lake Michigan, volunteering at hospice, riffing through produce at the grocery store, and going on walks through the MetroParks.  The total cost of a used, accessible van is between 40-45k. This includes the price of the van and around 20-25k in added conversions cost to make it handicap accessible. We are hoping to offset the conversion part of this purchase through the contributions we might raise. This is why we have chosen 25k as our target amount. We plan on closing this fundraiser at the end of August. To give clarity on our situation, my family is focusing their financial resources on modifying our house to include a first floor accessible bedroom and bathroom, so that my mom can stay at home. With this, in addition to upcoming care expenses and other adaptations, we are experiencing financial strain and would like to minimize any additional borrowing that we can. It is difficult to ask for help. I know that many of us are under financial strain due to COVID-19, and there are so many organizations to donate to that are fighting for racial and economic justice in our current moment. It is easy to feel like there is not enough, but we believe that orienting ourselves toward abundance, community, and generosity brings about the Kingdom of Heaven on Earth for all of us. If you cannot help financially, there are so many other ways to bless my mom during this time! Spiritual nourishment through phone calls, visits, mail, and prayer all bring joy to my mom. Thank you for taking the time to read this. We love you and are already so thankful to be a part of a caring community!!

This is where we need black educators, where we need representation, where we need support. As a permaculturaist, urban farmer, and educator I want to create a space that is accessible for folks. A haven that I would have wanted in my agriculture journey. I want to share my food growing experience with BIPOC. All of my experience has been on white owned farms that I didn't own and didn't walk away from with anything more than experience, callouses, and a dream to start my own farm. I want to create a system that better feeds us, brings us joy, provides us with jobs, and in turn heals the land that our ancestors stewarded. I'm so thankful for your support. Whether its just reading this and understanding. Or sharing with your friends and family. Or donating 5 dollars or donating 5 thousand dollars, I'm so thankful that I feel supported enough by you all to even begin this journey.I can't wait to post updates when we have reached goals to:1) Secure Land with water access2) Secure Farm Startup Infrastructure (1-2 hoop houses, irrigation, wash stations)3) Startup EquipmentI was born with hands stained crimson. The coagulated blood of the black women who came before me pulses through my veins. It is their calluses I can feel pushing through the tender surface of each aching palm; a young corn stalk fighting to witness the waning light. As the evening sun settles in sheets of solid grey I can hear the nay saying whisper “honey do not work the soil—this is not your land” and I do not take heed. The coming night forces elongated shadows into the city scape and the silhouettes of my tomato plants appear minacious, sinister, forboding and I do not mind. Sealed against a Los Angeles night sky I kick my worn boots against the compost bin door, loosening the compacted soil and frightening the flighty pigeons who come to the garden for corn and camaraderie. “Our family farmed until we didn’t have to anymore. And then we were free to live “ my great uncle once told me, gathered around a Thanksgiving table. “why would you want to go back to that?” he questioned. Helping himself to another ear of corn.If I pull up the weeds ,will I pull away the curtains of the past? Turning the soil and turning back the hands of time; each shovel full of dirt unearthing the still warm, still beating heart of a black woman.My grandmothers mother saying “you don't have to do this anymore.” What if I plant a seed? Will it grow not from the surface but from somewhere else, deep within the earth where our ancestors, unappeased, still dwell?I once met a young man of color at an earth skills gathering. We found solace in each others company and had no trouble falling into the deep conversations that I usually reserve for childhood friends. He told me he owned a farm thirty minutes from the rocky soils where I grew up. His farm is a cattle and produce farm and he told me that he regularly took in young black kids as apprentices. I expected him to speak of them with high regard, excitement for a future of farming people of color, envisioning a revolution in which our children take back the land. Instead, he disparaged them. He told me that they were “mostly useless” and that they were not concerned with how things grow or why we should want them to. He did not respect them. He did not see them as they are; young shoots of bamboo with delicate leaves and malleable stalks waiting for the moment that they might shoot toward the sky in lustered resilience. He failed to buoy their creativity and, in return, they did not flourish. When I was 20 I was a back-to the- lander. Folks would often ask me why I want to live without running water, to cook on a wood stove, and baptize myself in the occasional flowing stream in lieu of a hot shower? The answer then and now has always been simple: Because there are two wars being fought within the Black community—one is a war on health wherein we cannot access the foods that will nourish our being. The other is a war on our education wherein we cannot find the mentors to lend a hand of inclusivity. Many of the children of color that I work with feel the need to elevate their status. To show the world they are not ‘worthless’ despite what others have been lead to believe. Unfortunately, symbols of status and farming seem to be mutually exclusive. Living a life of resourcefulness wherein you do not depend on the capitalist regime is not favored. Farming becomes less and less important. Their fields lie fallow.The lessons that I have learned from the nights that I spend with my great, great grandmother, when she whispers to me through the white pines and tulip poplars bathed in the luminescence of a blood moon are lessons of resilience. Her voice comes to me like a waking dream, each word sturdy like a promise deep within my being where love takes root and understanding blooms. There is a place within the soul that fears that history will fold in on itself like the old accordion style road maps, each route colliding and melding into one confused loop. We are afraid that in climbing the ladder we might fall and land further down than we began. I want to silence this fear. I want to hold my grandmothers mothers hand, and together walking through my gardens I will  tell her, “ We made this. This land is ours”

My name is Carter Schott, and I am part of a family  of 6.  I have 3 older sisters, and live in Orland Park,  IL. My youngest sister and I are both affected by a disease called SMA (Spinal Muscular Atrophy) a form of Muscular Dystrophy.  The disease is characterized by not allowing my muscles to strengthen as I grow.  I have limited mobility and have used a power wheelchair since the age of 4.  I’m now 18 years old, and a Senior at Carl Sandburg High School.  I am very active in school participating in Robotics, Marching Band,  and Bass Fishing.  Academically my coursework includes all honors and AP classes while maintaining a 4.2 GPA.  I am a member of Mu Alpha Theta, National Honor Society, and Tri-M (Music Honors Society).  My most recent accomplishment was receiving the Heart of the Arts Award.  This is a National Award representing the Midwest United States.  The award is given to an individual who rises above their limitations to excel in both school and in the community.  In order to receive this award a couple of things that were considered are earning 300+ community service hours, as well as participating on the field as a percussionist in Marching Band despite being in a wheelchair.  I also took 2nd Place in the IHSA Bass Fishing Finals at Carlyle Lake, and 2nd Place at the FIRST Midwest Regional Competition for Robotics.My lifelong dream is to become a mechanical engineer trying to design products for people like myself to allow them better mobility and a more fulfilling life.  My plans are to follow the University of Illinois Engineering tract through Moraine Valley,  eventually transferring to the U of I campus. The purpose of this GoFundMe is to provide funding for a wheelchair accessible vehicle complete with hand controls so I can transport myself to and from college so I can secure my dream.  This vehicle is quite costly.  A package like  this new can cost upward of $70,000.  My plan is to fund a vehicle like this in good used condition for a lesser amount.I truly appreciate any support in helping me make my dream come true.

Bree is a brave young girl that just two weeks ago told Alli, “you’ll be good; I took all the bad luck for you”, that in the end, knocked out cancer like a true champion.

We see the atrocities committed at the hands of the police and we understand that the country we live in today was built on the oppression of Black Americans. We have seen Tatte’s supposed stance on Instagram as a supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement but unfortunately, we have yet to see tangible actions made by the corporation. During our time at Tatte, we have all learned the story of its founding and internalized the values the company defines itself by. ""Our mission,"" you claim, ""is to inspire, care for and touch every person, neighborhood, and city with our experience through our food, our passion, and our culture."" We believe that it is impossible to care for our community—within Boston and beyond—without acknowledging the horrors Black Americans have faced within the United States and making a clear commitment to using your privilege and financial resources to support organizations that work for justice. Tatte has looked to the Black community to fill available positions, whether it be in front of house, back of house, or in managerial positions. We believe that this hospitality should be extended outside of just clock-in and clock-out hours, especially when the lives of our Black employees are being threatened. It is Tatte’s duty to protect its Black employees who work every day to uphold the Tatte Mission Statement.Similar businesses, such as Blue Bottle, Pret a Manger, Pavement Coffeehouse, etc. have donated and matched their employees’ donations towards BLM funds. In response to this, we are hereby petitioning Tatte to match its employee donations dollar for dollar. We have organized a GoFundMe page — linked below — to compile all current donations. The donations will be evenly distributed to the American Civil Liberties Union, BLM of Boston, and the Boston Mutual Aid Fund. As Tatte employees, we are hungry for change in our communities, and we are asking our employer to support us in this endeavor. With that being said, we will be asking Tatte to match whatever we raise.We have (1) employee with the GoFundMe login who's sole job is distributing the funds. Once the money is withdrawn, it will be donated to the three organizations --money will be split equally three ways. and screenshots will immediately be posted to ensure there is a level of transparency. Two of the three organizations have donation portals on their sites so money will be sent that way. The last org ( the boston mutual aid fund) is smaller and for that reason that money will be sent to them via cashapp."

Hi! My name is Erin Field and I’m 24 years old. Three years ago I became a C5 quadriplegic. When I go anywhere my mom transfers me to the passenger seat of her car with a slide board and then has to take my wheelchair apart. This is very difficult for her and for me. I don’t have much strength or balance so it is a lot on my mom and her back has been hurting her a lot. We have not been able to afford a wheelchair accessible van as they are very expensive. I can’t explain how much this would help us. I go to therapy and  doctors appointments at least four times a week. With a van, it would be so much easier and faster to get in and out and my mom would not have to lift me or take my chair apart. At this point I am desperate because I do not want to have to stop going to therapy due to not being able to get in the car. I will also get hand controls so I will eventually be able to drive the van myself when I am more independent. Any donation amount will help. Thank you so much! I will attach photos and a video of how we currently transfer sped up x4.

Help Her Start A New Life	New York, NY	27334	25000	729	25 days 00:49:13.411197000	613	725	741	After serving almost 22 years in prison, a new law in New York State called the Domestic Violence Survivors Justice Act (DVSJA) allowed a Judge to reconsider the 25 years to life prison sentence of my aunt Patrice. The presiding Judge carefully considered the effects of the sexual abuse Patrice endured starting when she was just 15 years old.  In 1998, when she was tried and convicted,  no one believed that a pastor would abuse a young girl.  Her trial and conviction took place when she was 16 years old in 1998. She just came home a few weeks ago, at the age of 38. Patrice is one of the first people released under the DVSJA. In her decision resentencing Patrice Smith under the new law, the Judge wrote: “The 'full picture' here is one of a 16 year old girl who had been raped, abused and coerced by a man 55 years her senior, who had exploited and coerced her through escalating offers of money and gifts for sex and by threatening to expose the relationship to her father. The repeated abuse defendant endured cannot be compartmentalized or separated from her actions on the night of the crime. They are inextricably interlinked...What we have learned in the two decades since the defendant's sentencing is that domestic violence should be viewed by our criminal justice system in a manner that recognizes not only their status as offenders but their status as survivors.”It is under this umbrella that I am asking the community to help support  Patrice's reentry into society. As I am only twenty years old, my aunt has been incarcerated for my entire life. I along with my three sisters grew up visiting her in prison, spending the nights through the facility’s Family Reunion Program. She never once hinted at a traumatic past. She instead encouraged us, played with us, kept our secrets and most of all,  loved us. It was not until I was an adult that I learned her real story, and even now when I speak to her I am amazed at how encouraging and optimistic she is and I am so proud of her. Our family is rejoicing together now that she is home with us. While incarcerated Patrice earned her Associate’s and Bachelor’s degrees. She is now hoping to join a Master’s program. In addition she plans to help educate the public about the new DVSJA law,  with hopes of freeing more criminalized survivors, and ultimately  getting similar laws passed in more states.My aunt Patrice can never get back the years she lost in prison, but with your help she may be able to prevent another young girl from enduring this abuse or being silenced by it. Please give to help Patrice start a new life in freedom and community building. Patrice's case in the news:Judge grants Patrice Smith freedom Judge has mercy on Buffalo woman Photo copyright Sara Bennett 2020

Making this is not only the hardest few paragraphs that I’ve ever had to write, but it’s also one of those things that I never thought I would be doing, especially at 25 years old.
Taylor Symone Hill, aka “Monks”, a nickname given by my mom, was born February 4, 2001. She was a daughter, cousin, niece, friend, an older sister of 2, and my younger sister. From the day she was born she made a special impact in everyone’s life, effortlessly lighting up the rooms she walked in, with just a smile. Taylor’s love and energy is missed everyday, not a minute has gone by where we haven’t all wished for just one last “one last” with her. One last Laugh. One last Kiss. One last Hug. One last Smile. 
Taylor was placed on this Earth with the purpose of always giving back and wanting more for everyone. She was attending Rutgers, with aspirations of becoming an RN. As her big brother, I had the responsibility of protecting my sister making sure she got everything she wished for, and with this GoFundMe, I need everyone’s help in doing just that. 

With the proceeds being donated towards Monks’Memorial we plan to create a foundation in Taylor’s name with the purpose of keeping Taylor’s memory and the love she had for people alive by awarding the next generation of rising stars, scholarship money in her name. "

He was known for both his industry knowledge and ability to innovate. For decades Mitch delivered superior results, led global teams, developed incredible business relationships.  Mitch helped build businesses from the ground up and then led by example every day since.  He was a world-class Financial Services expert and leader in every sense. While Mitch’s professional accomplishments are immense and inspiring, he was an even better person, a loyal and loving friend, an incredible father, a sports enthusiast, and someone who would always go out of his way to lend a helping hand.  Mitch was someone you could turn to for help during a tough day, even if that just meant getting a few good laughs in.  His boys were his pride and joy; Brandon, 20 is about to enter his junior year at Syracuse University while Justin, 16 is attending High School with college right around the corner. The boys’ education was very important to Mitch and he saw it as his top priority.  Mitch has touched the lives of so many through his personal and professional interactions and no surprise many of you have reached out to see how you could help and recognize and remember Mitch. There was no bigger priority for Mitch and his wife than to provide every opportunity for their sons, Brandon and Justin. It is with this purpose that we are starting this fundraising campaign to help Brandon and Justin complete their education as a legacy to Mitch.   This message and any attachments are intended only for the use of the addressee and may contain information that is privileged and confidential.

Philip Gutter was a talented, kind, and determined boy who died decades too soon.  In his memory, we are raising funds to build ""Philip's Supreme Court"" an impressive outdoor basketball court that will be located at Bayside Middle School in Bayside, Wisconsin.  Philip attended Bayside Middle School as a fifth grader and was scheduled to begin his sixth grade year. 

Philip loved basketball and enjoyed being on the Nicolet Junior Knights Basketball team.  Philip and his brother Evan's beloved  and caring father,  Booker Gutter, coached both sons on the team.   Philip's Supreme Court is particularly meaningful to Booker and Evan given Philip's love of basketball. Booker with his sons Philip and Evan Brothers Philip and Evan with loving parents, Booker and Megan.Philip also aspired to be the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.  Hence, ""Philip's Supreme Court.""     Philip's Supreme Court will feature a durable and safe surface. We have partnered with RRECC x SNAPSPORTS WI to retrofit the existing outdoor basketball court with two new regulation goals and SnapSports athletic surfacing.  The court will be lined and covered with custom logos and Philip's #33 will appear at centercourt.  Thousands of children and teenagers will enjoy playing basketball on this court for decades to come.  This is such a beautiful and appropriate way to honor a boy who touched the hearts of all who were blessed to know him.Sample rendering below:Philip, age 11, along with his cherished mom and grandfather died in a tragic car accident.  His loyal and loving brother Evan, age 12, survived the accident.   Evan lives with his caring father Booker and together they support one another through their grief. Details:  https://www.jsonline.com/story/communities/northshore/news/fox-point/2020/08/06/bayside-middle-school-student-philip-gutter-megan-haak-mark-haak-killed-car-crash-minnesota/3303795001/Philip's Supreme Court will be a lasting tribute to a very special boy. Booker shared with us that Philip used to say ""Celebrate what's right with the world.""   While his loss is a horrific tragedy, this court will indeed allow us to celebrate his beautiful legacy. We have a variety of sponsorship opportunities available including ""Megan's Benches"" which will be a special seating area in memory of Philip and Evan's loving mom, Megan.   She enjoyed attending her son's games and these benches will pay tribute to a very kind and caring mom. Megan with her sons Evan and PhilipSpecial thanks to the Milwaukee North Shore Rotary Club for sponsorship our Honorary and Memorial Brick Walkway that will be located adjacent to Philip's Supreme Court.  All contributions of $150 or more will include the opportunity to engrave a brick with a message of your choice.

Theologos is an experimental community centering a diverse selection of believing Oxford students in daily prayer and worship.  The small cohort will study scripture, theology, apologetics and christian ministry.  We will be unpacking the big questions of our generation in Oxford’s ancient halls.  For far too long the realm of the spirit has gone unsung in the academy, and Theologos is seeking to remedy this.Most notably, in residence is the authoritative theologian NT Wright; a foremost authority on the Apostle Paul and a personal hero of mine.  His making himself available by meeting with Theologos weekly is a massive privilege.  If he is unknown to you, imagine discussing your reading over lunch with a modern day CS Lewis.  He’s a very big deal! Wycliffe Hall has assembled a diverse group for the program.  I personally have spent the last 7 years at Bethel where I completed three years of the Bethel School of Supernatural Ministry and was discipled for 4 years in the realm of spiritual intelligence. I have focused on developing my gift of discerning of spirits and honing a strong awareness of atmospheres, relational dynamics and Heaven’s blueprints over humans and cities.  I am honored to now take that experience into the scholastic halls of the academy!Where this will lead, I don’t know —but I am no stranger to Oxford.  Heaven likes this place.  I worked for St Aldates, the Anglican church in the heart of Oxford from 2012 -2013, and have returned often since to build relationships with residents and minister to the city.  In its streets I feel the massive creative potential and powerful authority the inhabitants are tapping into.  Simon Ponsonby, a pastor of theology at St Aldates, explained to me that it was actually the plan of Adolf Hitler to rule the Third Reich from Oxford.  Remarkably, the city, while beautiful and ancient, is not the prettiest of Europe, nor the most strategically situated.  Hitler’s plans only make sense to those who look in the spirit.  This city, known for its intellectuals, is a seat of power.  World leaders spend formative years in Oxford and many influential hearts and minds pass through it.  It is a sobering privilege to worship amongst them, learn with them, and to pray for them.  It is humbling and exciting to take part in a story so much bigger than me!My flight is booked.  My room secured.  I even have all of my books for the course! BUT like every great story a test has presented itself, my hurtle to overcome:  I was denied the loan to cover my tuition. I was genuinely surprised.  I had a little cry, indulged a brief panic, and then asked a host of friends what the Lord was saying. I didn't tell them what the problem was, just asked for the solution.Without even knowing the situation, the overwhelming response to their prayers was that I was to go.  To jump, to buckle up, to launch, to trust and watch Him make it happen.  And so that's where you find me: following Jesus into the unknown. Here's the situation: I have less than a week to raise $25,000 to apply for my visa. The deadline is this Friday, August 14.I know.  This is literally impossible. But also a wonderful wall worth walking through.  I think the Lord is assembling a puzzle, one that involves many players.  I believe the launching of the Theologos program is a part of the interlocking jigsaw God is assembling in the earth to bring spiritual intelligence into the conversation.  I don’t profess to know the full picture, but I know that I too want to be a puzzle piece.  I want to sit across from the brightest minds in Oxford’s darkest halls and speak not only from the mind or the heart, but spirit to spirit.  I want to be on the streets of ”The City of Dreaming Spires” as other pieces awaken.  Will you invest in me? Emily

Molly is no ordinary woman. She’s a police officer, a K9 handler, a wife, a step-mother, a dog-mom and an inspiration to thousands. Molly has a unique way of connecting with her Instagram followers, whether it’s with her hilarious videos of her dogs or her honesty, transparent and graceful way in which she discusses topics that usually make people uncomfortable or sad. If all of that has not drawn people to her, it’s her kindness that does. Undeterred by the negative attitude towards the police and with what little free time she has she, Molly encourages people to be kind to one of other and leads in this by example. Molly organizes K9 teams to go to surprise ill children at their homes with K9 parades. She fundraises and arranges for equipment for other K9’s in her department. Molly loves to give back to her community through random acts of kindness such as the raising the funds to give a large tip to a waitress, sending teachers Lando swag to thank them for the job they do etc.  Molly has an incredible upbeat and happy disposition despite everything she has had to deal with.
 
Molly is aware that we want to do this for her and with her blessing we have organized this Go Fund me. Molly would never ask for anything from anyone for herself, which is why this Go Fund me for her is so special to many of us. Molly has been very honest about her previous struggles with anorexia in the past but that was a long time ago and has also documented her struggles with infertility in hopes of helping others who are struggling like her. Molly’s dream is to become a mother and we want to help ease the financial burden that comes with this kind of treatment. She has endured endless tests, procedures, and treatments in her efforts to become pregnant. Molly has become pregnant only to have the  pregnancy end in heartbreak. After exhausting all options Molly and big old cop husband need a more invasive and expensive treatment called IVF. We want Molly to concentrate her efforts on getting her body and mind ready for pregnancy and not to worry about the monetary aspect. Molly has given unselfishly of herself to others and now we have the ability to give unselfishly back to her.
 
We appreciate any and all donations. Please watch for patches, stickers, coins etc. that you will be able to purchase in support of Molly. We will also be having raffles with amazing prizes. Special thank you to the small businesses that have come forward with donations and special pricing for this fundraiser. We are humbled by everyone who has reached out to help. It shows how much Molly means to the K9 and police community.
 
Many thanks for your support. Please donate and share    #teambabygroce

Friends, relatives, comrades and other loved ones. I’m deciding to create this fundraiser on this New Moon during Black August to set intentions for things I wish for myself.Without giving a long grocery list of things I’ve done for the many communities I’m part of let me just say hello, my name is edxi.  I’m a community organizer, writer and artist, always  doing my best, attempting to be the best relative and future ancestor I can be for my Black, Filipinx and Nitsítaapi blood fam and non huMAN relatives.  Trans womn & femmes of color, particularly Black trans womn deserve to ask for the things they wish to receive in the world like anyone else, beyond gender confirming surgeries, support after we’re bashed or for funeral costs of friends n loved ones.  Despite the work we do or visibility we have. So I’m extending my ask to anyone and everyone I know or don’t know in helping me in achieving my dangerous dreams of becoming the self that I wish to see in this world.I’m trying to not be reluctant in the asks I make of others or my community for fear of judgements, And I’m asking anyway.  The funds I’m asking for will cover a huge portion of  my surgeries, mental health and after care.  Much love to many others who’ve inspired me and encouraged me to make these asks. May we all find freedom. 

 

love & solidarity, edxi

#breelynnstrongDiffuse midline glioma, also known as glioblastoma, a non-curable and aggressive form of cancer that has given me a life expectancy of possibly a year. That’s my diagnosis and that’s what I’m fighting. As I try to sit here and type this out it’s really hard to find the words I want to say while fighting back the tears. I’m frustrated and angry because at 22 I should be thinking of my future husband and the babies I’m supposed to hold in my arms and call my own, and I don’t get that. I’m supposed to finish nursing school and get a degree and help others going through what I’m going through, and I don’t get that. I’m supposed to be hanging out with my friends and partying but instead I get a hospital bed a a body that’s tired and fighting with everything it has.And as much as I can sit here and be mad and upset and confused, I don’t want that, because the life I have lived and am still living is so amazing and filled with so many blessings that I am so thankful for. I’m at peace with death because I believe in a God that is SO MUCH greater than a diagnosis and ultimately has the final say in this. This fight isn’t over and I will give it all I have. But I want everyone to know that Heaven is real and when my time does come it’ll be a beautiful thing and I’m not scared of that. 

I just want everyone to know how much I love God and how this world, not just for me, is temporary and we have a wonderful forever home waiting for us.I’m making this go fund me page to help me check off some things on the bucket list and I know you guys want to help in any way you can so hopefully this gives you a way to do that, but not feel obligated. I want this next year to be filled with experiences with my family so I can get the best quality time with them. Trips, weekendgetaways, medical help and just travel fortreatments. 

My family and I appreciate all the help and words of encouragement. Prayers are so powerful and I believe this is going to be a GOOD fight. We got this, and God’s got me❤️

My wife is going through a very difficult immigration process (click on above links to read the details) though she has lived in the U.S. since she was an infant. She was raised as an American and believed herself to be a citizen until she was 22 years old. She's a wonderful woman. Any country would be happy to have people like her. Though America doesn't recognize her right now, I believe it someday will. I believe my wife will get to call America ""home"" again without reservation. We have been working diligently for 5 years now, doing everything within our power to obtain legal status for my wife. It's been a long and difficult journey with a series of small heartbreaks along the way. I want my wife to live in this country, her country, without fear of being detained and/or deported to a country she knows nothing about. Last year, I hired a great immigration lawyer. With great legal help comes great financial responsibilities. I'm afraid that with the direction this case is taking, we may be in over our heads financially. If we do go to federal court (and it looks like we will), it will likely cost a lot of money in legal fees. I was quoted $25k to 40k in legal fees by a different attorney last year in order to take my wife's case to court - hence the large goal amount on this fundraiser.I ask you to partner with us in this whether it's financially, prayerfully, or writing letters to your Congressional Representatives in support of private bills S. 3490 - A bill for the relief of Rebecca Trimble (in the Senate) and H.R. 7807 - For the relief of Rebecca Trimble (in the House). These must be approved in both parts of Congress and then be signed by the President to become a private law granting Becky permanent residency.If you would like a template support letter, I have two examples that may be helpful. If enough Senators and Representatives start hearing about Rebecca's case, it can make a huge difference. Make a comment if you would like the example letters and I  can send them via email.I came across this Bible passage awhile back and it struck a chord in my heart because of our situation. It's provided a lot of encouragement to me during difficult times...""Trust in the Lord and do good. Then you will live safely in the land and prosper. Take delight in the Lord , and he will give you your heart’s desires. Commit everything you do to the Lord . Trust him, and he will help you. He will make your innocence radiate like the dawn, and the justice of your cause will shine like the noonday sun.""Psalms 37:3‭-‬6 NLTWith gratitude and clinging to His promises,John"

I met Mr Walter outside the Publix on Ocala Rd. (feel free to visit him and buy a paper! he’s very kind and can hold conversation well if you just take the time to listen). Over the course of this fundraiser I have made many changes, it started off very small and with the intention of just helping him find a physical trainer, which we have, that would help him play chess again as he stated in his sign. I raised the goal from 1k to 10k when many people who knew him showed more interest in helping out. I’m so completely thrilled to have reached that goal, but Mr Walter needs our help again as I have just gone to see him and he has expressed his desire for a new home. I’ve been to his home and it is a pretty tight space for his chair, he said that he wanted bigger doorways and hallways, more room in general. He said he wanted a laundry room and a more accessible bathroom, all of which are definitely possible with this new goal. There is a renewed aching in my heart once again to help our friend achieve his dreams and live a comfortable rest of his life. Please share and donate where you can, this is a kind and beautiful soul, with a brilliant mind that deserves peace. He is cherished and loved by his community and all who have the privilege of meeting him."

However, since 2018 I’ve worked in customer service averaging around 26 hours weekly and only getting paid $9.75 hourly. It’s a stable position and I’m grateful for it because a lot of people don’t have jobs right now, but it’s becoming too much to bear. 

I live with my grandparents, and while I do love them, I don’t feel like they understand me or my struggles as the person I am. I want to move on, I want to transition and I want to be great. I want to be loved, but most importantly,
I want to be happy. 
If you could spare even a dollar for my cause it would make my entire life so much better. Thank you in advance.
